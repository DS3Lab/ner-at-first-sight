# Named Entity Recognition at First Sight

We manually annotated various eye-tracking corpora with named entity labels (PERSON, ORGANIZATION, LOCATION). We do not re-distribute the original eye-tracking data. Hence, these files only contain text and named entity annotations.

This repository contains the data used for the following papers:

"[Entity Recognition at First Sight: Improving NER with Eye Movement Information](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N19-1001/)" by Nora Hollenstein &amp; Ce Zhang (NAACL, 2019).  
Data used: Dundee, GECO, ZuCo 1.0 (sentiment and normal reading)

"[Advancing NLP with Cognitive Language Processing Signals](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.02682.pdf)" by Nora Hollenstein et al. (ArXiV preprint, 2019).  
Data used: ZuCo 1.0 (sentiment and normal reading)

## Annotation Guidelines

The datasets were annotated by two NLP experts. The IOB tagging scheme was used for the labeling. We followed the [ACE Annotation Guidelines](https://www.ldc.upenn.edu/sites/www.ldc.upenn.edu/files/english-relations-guidelines-v6.2.pdf) (Linguistic Data Consortium, 2005).
