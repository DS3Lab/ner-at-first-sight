Our	O

it	O

The	O

what	O
are	O
we	O
to	O

The	O
answer	O
to	O
that	O
was	O

as	O
long	O

as	O
1988	O
when	O

The	O

encourage	O
the	O

it	O
too	O
has	O
met	O
with	O
a	O

The	O
outlook	O
,	O
then	O
,	O
is	O
bleak	O

We	O
are	O
just	O
such	O

excuses	O
about	O
the	O
untrustworthy	O
nature	O
of	O

The	O
answer	O
would	O
seem	O
to	O
lie	O
in	O
the	O
Government	B-ORG
providing	O
a	O
much	O
more	O
ambitious	O
version	O
of	O
the	O

that	O
would	O
make	O
private	O

a	O
safer	O
investment	O
,	O
possibly	O
linked	O
to	O
an	O
element	O
of	O

And	O
we	O
need	O
to	O
recognise	O
that	O
there	O
will	O
always	O
be	O
those	O
who	O
will	O
never	O

enough	O

This	O

Another	O
sign	O
that	O
the	O
magazine	O
was	O
not	O
totally	O
at	O
ease	O
with	O
sex	O
was	O
its	O
reliance	O
on	O
American	O
sexologists	O
.	O

You	O
do	O
n't	O
need	O
to	O
be	O

qualified	O
to	O
explain	O
the	O
female	O
orgasm	O
or	O
how	O
to	O
do	O

,	O
but	O
Cosmo	O
's	O
contributors	O
tended	O
to	O
have	O
strings	O
of	O
letters	O
after	O
their	O
names	O
,	O
and	O
jobs	O
at	O
American	O
universities	O
.	O

This	O
may	O
have	O
reflected	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
Cosmo	O
was	O
originally	O
an	O
American	O
magazine	O
,	O
founded	O
by	O
the	O
formidable	O
Helen	B-PER
Gurley	I-PER
Brown	I-PER
,	O
author	O
of	O
Sex	O
and	O
the	O
Single	O
Girl	O
.	O

But	O
it	O
also	O
suggests	O
a	O
need	O
to	O
lend	O
professional	O
respectability	O
to	O
what	O
would	O
otherwise	O
have	O
remained	O
taboo	O
subjects	O
.	O

It	O
may	O
also	O
have	O
reflected	O
the	O
confusion	O
many	O
of	O
its	O
readers	O
were	O
feeling	O
.	O

While	O
the	O
Sixties	O
is	O
fixed	O

everyone	O

a	O

decade	O

some	O
of	O
its	O
most	O
long-reaching	O
effects	O
only	O
made	O
themselves	O
felt	O
later	O
.	O

This	O
is	O
particularly	O
TRUE	O
of	O
feminism	O
,	O
which	O
got	O
going	O
in	O
the	O
Seventies	O
and	O
was	O
in	O
many	O
ways	O
a	O
reaction	O
to	O
the	O
maleness	O
of	O
the	O
sexual	O
revolution	O
.	O

Cosmo	O
arrived	O
at	O
a	O
moment	O
when	O
the	O
word	O
``	O
girl	O
''	O
was	O
already	O
going	O
out	O
of	O
fashion	O
,	O
soon	O
to	O
be	O
used	O
only	O
by	O
male	O
chauvinists	O
or	O
with	O
irony	O
by	O
women	O
themselves	O
;	O
the	O
magazine	O
was	O
both	O
ahead	O
and	O
behind	O
the	O
times	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
a	O
tendency	O
to	O
preach	O
to	O
its	O
readers	O
.	O

But	O
it	O
treated	O
them	O
as	O
people	O
,	O
with	O
the	O
same	O
breadth	O
of	O
interests	O
and	O
ambitions	O
as	O
men	O
.	O

It	O
assumed	O
they	O
could	O
cope	O
with	O
highbrow	O
fiction	O

and	O
pages	O
of	O
type	O
without	O
the	O

It	O
quickly	O
lost	O
its	O
ambivalence	O

about	O
the	O

there	O

It	O
had	O
lost	O

or	O

knew	O
that	O

with	O
the	O
public	O

he	O
did	O
not	O

how	O
to	O

that	O
right	O

But	O
he	O
had	O
learnt	O
an	O
important	O
lesson	O
from	O
the	O
Thatcher	B-PER
years	O
,	O
when	O
British	O
business	O
,	O
so	O
long	O
depressed	O

had	O
sprung	O
ahead	O

recovered	O
its	O
status	O
in	O
world	O
markets	O

From	O
the	O
outset	O
,	O
he	O
was	O
convinced	O
that	O
the	O
answer	O
to	O
any	O
problem	O
he	O
encountered	O
in	O

was	O
to	O
bring	O
in	O
a	O
businessman	O
to	O
solve	O
it	O
for	O
him	O

That	O
is	O
a	O
simplistic	O
view	O

Not	O
all	O
parts	O
of	O
the	O
public	O
service	O
are	O
susceptible	O
to	O
the	O
business	O

Businessmen	O
are	O
there	O
to	O

have	O
to	O
provide	O
services	O
to	O
people	O
from	O
whom	O
no	O

could	O
ever	O

expected	O

activities	O
of	O

not	O
all	O
be	O
reduced	O

commercial	O
imperatives	O

is	O
an	O

dimension	O
of	O
public	O

of	O
politics	O

But	O
as	O
Mr	O
Blair	B-PER
demonstrated	O
over	O
his	O
handling	O
of	O
the	O
Rose	B-PER

case	O
,	O
he	O
does	O
not	O
believe	O
that	O
the	O
public	O
is	O
entitled	O
to	O
complain	O
about	O
the	O
services	O
it	O
receives	O
.	O

He	O
is	O
also	O
impatient	O
about	O
politics	O
.	O

If	O
he	O
ever	O
did	O
,	O
he	O
no	O
longer	O
believes	O
that	O
the	O
answer	O
to	O
political	O
questions	O
lies	O
in	O
the	O
rough	O
and	O
tumble	O
of	O
debate	O

He	O
believes	O
that	O
he	O
is	O

to	O
call	O
in	O
the	O
disinterested	O
expertise	O
of	O
businessmen	O

and	O
that	O
when	O
he	O
has	O
done	O
so	O

This	O
will	O

better	O
than	O

Above	O

by	O
exercising	O
undue	O
influence	O
over	O

it	O
will	O

Mr	O

wrote	O
to	O

considering	O
``	O
dumbing	O
down	O
''	O
its	O
coverage	O
of	O

But	O
few	O
-	O
apart	O
from	O

junkies	O
such	O
as	O
me	O

would	O

blame	O
Greg	B-PER
Dyke	I-PER
,	O
the	O
director	O

,	O
for	O
looking	O
at	O
new	O
ways	O
of	O
making	O
politics	O
less	O
boring	O
to	O
viewers	O
.	O

The	O
fact	O
is	O
that	O
apathy	O
,	O
reflected	O
at	O
the	O
low	O
turnout	O
in	O
elections	O
,	O
is	O
also	O
mirrored	O
in	O
the	O
turn-off	O
that	O
politics	O
has	O
become	O
for	O
many	O
viewers	O
and	O
listeners	O
.	O

Before	O
the	O
politicians	O
get	O
too	O
high	O
and	O
mighty	O
they	O
should	O
momentarily	O
spare	O
a	O
thought	O
for	O
Mr	O
Dyke	B-PER
as	O
he	O
wonders	O
why	O
so	O
few	O
``	O

people	O
-	O
especially	O
the	O

actually	O
watch	O
his	O

Do	O
n't	O
get	O
me	O
wrong	O
,	O
I	O
am	O
not	O
against	O
the	O
desire	O
to	O
maintain	O
the	O
interest	O
of	O
the	O

in	O

and	O
I	O
think	O
that	O
any	O
attempt	O
to	O
reduce	O
the	O
output	O
of	O
political	O
coverage	O
would	O
be	O
a	O
mistake	O

In	O
fact	O
,	O
more	O
than	O
that	O
,	O
I	O
also	O
have	O
a	O
financial	O
interest	O
to	O

I	O
am	O
privileged	O
to	O
take	O
part	O
in	O
many	O

I	O
would	O
suffer	O
,	O
financially	O
,	O
as	O
a	O
consequence	O
.	O

I	O
find	O
it	O
ironic	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
have	O
the	O
opportunity	O
of	O
participating	O
far	O
more	O
these	O
days	O
on	O
radio	O
and	O
television	O
than	O
I	O
ever	O
did	O
as	O
an	O
MP	O
.	O

Maybe	O
that	O
should	O
tell	O
us	O
something	O

It	O
could	O
be	O
that	O
,	O
tied	O
to	O
a	O

a	O
pager	O

a	O

,	O
I	O
had	O
nothing	O
useful	O

Now	O
that	O
I	O
have	O
to	O
use	O
my	O

this	O

for	O

and	O
this	O
all	O
points	O
to	O
a	O
pretty	O
impressive	O
coverage	O
for	O
what	O
is	O
,	O
in	O
large	O
measure	O
,	O
just	O
a	O
minority	O
pursuit	O
.	O

If	O
anything	O
,	O
it	O
can	O
be	O
argued	O
,	O
with	O
some	O
justification	O
,	O
that	O
the	O
BBC	B-ORG
's	O
output	O
has	O
actually	O
increased	O
in	O
recent	O
years	O
.	O

So	O
no	O
politician	O
can	O
claim	O
that	O
there	O
has	O
been	O
any	O
dumbing-down	O
yet	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
Greg	B-PER
Dyke	I-PER
has	O
a	O
right	O
to	O
ask	O
whether	O
his	O
viewers	O
are	O
actually	O
watching	O
or	O
listening	O
to	O
any	O
of	O
these	O
programmes	O
.	O

There	O
are	O
some	O
(	O
I	O
am	O
one	O
)	O
that	O
say	O
that	O
he	O
has	O
a	O
duty	O
to	O
provide	O
programmes	O
on	O
political	O
affairs	O
regardless	O
of	O
how	O
many	O
are	O
tuning	O
in	O
.	O

But	O
he	O
,	O
in	O
turn	O
,	O
is	O
entitled	O
to	O
ask	O
why	O
so	O
few	O
licence-payers	O
are	O
thanking	O
him	O
for	O
such	O
coverage	O
.	O

Could	O
it	O
be	O
because	O
it	O
is	O
the	O
politicians	O
themselves	O
,	O
rather	O
than	O
the	O
broadcasters	O
,	O
who	O
are	O
dumbing	O
down	O
?	O

Parliament	B-ORG
has	O
only	O
itself	O
to	O
blame	O
if	O
its	O
proceedings	O
are	O
such	O
a	O
turn-off	O
.	O

And	O
if	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
programmes	O
go	O
out	O
at	O
an	O
inconvenient	O
time	O
,	O
could	O
this	O
not	O
be	O
because	O
of	O
the	O
inconvenient	O
hours	O
that	O
the	O
Commons	O
currently	O
sits	O
?	O

The	O
trouble	O
is	O
that	O
politicians	O
rarely	O
watch	O
or	O
listen	O
to	O
television	O
or	O
radio	O
and	O
maybe	O
are	O
simply	O
unaware	O
of	O
just	O
how	O
unappetising	O
they	O
appear	O
to	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
us	O
.	O

One	O
can	O
hardly	O
blame	O
the	O
BBC	B-ORG
for	O
wanting	O
to	O
get	O
away	O
from	O
simply	O
covering	O
the	O
proceedings	O
of	O
a	O
largely	O
empty	O
Commons	B-ORG
chamber	O
where	O
there	O
are	O
often	O
only	O
a	O
dozen	O
or	O
so	O
MPs	O
present	O
.	O

The	O
only	O
significant	O
thing	O
that	O
registers	O
in	O
the	O
minds	O
of	O
some	O
viewers	O
is	O
the	O
backcloth	O
of	O
empty	O
green	O
benches	O
.	O

Perhaps	O
if	O
MPs	O
attended	O
the	O
debates	O
in	O
larger	O
numbers	O
,	O
there	O
might	O
be	O
more	O
of	O
an	O
incentive	O
to	O
want	O
to	O
watch	O
.	O

Ironically	O
,	O
it	O
has	O
been	O
the	O
provision	O
of	O
the	O
live	O
TV	O
``	O
feed	O
''	O
to	O
MPs	O
in	O
their	O
swanky	O
offices	O
that	O
has	O
been	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
reasons	O
for	O
the	O
decline	O
in	O
attendance	O
.	O

Then	O
there	O
are	O
the	O
cringe-making	O
Labour	B-ORG
stooges	O
who	O
ask	O
their	O
idiotic	O
scripted	O
questions	O
along	O
the	O
lines	O
of	O
:	O
``	O
Is	O
the	O
Prime	O

aware	O
that	O

is	O

''	O

This	O
week	O
the	O
Speaker	O
ruled	O
that	O
the	O
Leader	O

the	O
Opposition	O
could	O
not	O
ask	O
the	O
Prime	O

questions	O
about	O
the	O
Labour	B-ORG
Party	I-ORG
and	O
its	O
funding	O
by	O

implying	O
that	O
Mr	O
Blair	B-PER
,	O
as	O
Prime	O
Minister	O
,	O
was	O
not	O
responsible	O
for	O
the	O
Labour	B-ORG
Party	I-ORG
.	O

This	O
is	O
bizarre	O
.	O

Presumably	O
,	O
this	O
strict	O
interpretation	O
means	O
that	O
Parliament	B-ORG
can	O
not	O
now	O
even	O
question	O
ministers	O
on	O
the	O
leaked	O
Labour	B-ORG
Party	I-ORG
health	O

that	O
suggests	O
that	O
the	O

,	O
in	O

,	O
be	O
less	O
than	O

of	O
use	O

The	O
attempts	O
to	O
stifle	O
open	O
debate	O
in	O
the	O
Commons	B-ORG
mean	O
that	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
us	O
,	O
the	O
impression	O
is	O
reinforced	O
that	O
Parliament	B-ORG
is	O
a	O
place	O
where	O
questions	O
in	O
debates	O
simply	O
go	O
unanswered	O
.	O

And	O
when	O
,	O
anyway	O
,	O
so	O
many	O
of	O
the	O
broadcasters	O
are	O
then	O
confronted	O
with	O
the	O
refusal	O
of	O
ministers	O
to	O
appear	O
on	O
programmes	O
,	O
who	O
can	O
blame	O
Mr	O
Dyke	B-PER
for	O
wondering	O
if	O
the	O
manner	O
of	O
political	O
coverage	O
should	O
not	O
be	O
reviewed	O
?	O

How	O
many	O
times	O
do	O
we	O
hear	O
interviewers	O
saying	O
``	O
We	O
invited	O
a	O
minister	O
to	O
appear	O
but	O
none	O
were	O
available	O
''	O
?	O

In	O
such	O
circumstances	O
it	O
is	O
the	O

'	O
evasions	O
that	O
are	O
responsible	O
for	O
the	O

It	O
would	O
be	O
sad	O
if	O
politics	O
were	O
to	O
lose	O
the	O
attention	O
of	O
the	O
BBC	B-ORG

but	O
it	O

up	O

Mr	O
Hain	B-PER
,	O
a	O
veteran	O
of	O
the	O
Welsh	O
referendum	O
,	O
knows	O
all	O
this	O
.	O

One	O
counter-argument	O
is	O
this	O
:	O
supposing	O
Mr	O
Blair	B-PER
became	O
unpopular	O
and	O
the	O
referendum	O
became	O
one	O
on	O
his	O
premiership	O
,	O
rather	O
as	O
the	O
French	O
Maastricht	O
referendum	O
was	O
on	O
Franois	B-PER
Mitterand	I-PER
's	O
record	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
given	O
that	O
Mr	O
Blair	B-PER
's	O
popularity	O
remains	O
undented	O
after	O
the	O
pounding	O
he	O
has	O
had	O
in	O
the	O
last	O
few	O
weeks	O
,	O
it	O
's	O
difficult	O
to	O
see	O
how	O
this	O
would	O
happen	O
.	O

In	O
that	O
sense	O
ministers	O
may	O
be	O
right	O
when	O
they	O
say	O
that	O
the	O
press	O
may	O
be	O
less	O
in	O
touch	O
than	O
they	O
are	O
.	O

That	O
is	O
n't	O
to	O
say	O
a	O
referendum	O
would	O
not	O
be	O
a	O
gamble	O
-	O
albeit	O
a	O
sensible	O
one	O
.	O

If	O
the	O
Cabinet	B-ORG
were	O
to	O
hold	O
-	O
an	O
unprecedented	O
event	O
-	O
a	O
substantive	O
meeting	O
on	O
the	O
issue	O
,	O
there	O
would	O
probably	O
be	O
a	O
majority	O
in	O
favour	O
of	O
doing	O
what	O
Mr	O
Blair	B-PER
wanted	O
because	O
he	O
wanted	O
it	O
.	O

Margaret	B-PER
Beckett	I-PER
appears	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
striking	O
,	O
if	O
tentative	O
,	O
convert	O
.	O

But	O
there	O
are	O
caveats	O
.	O

Firstly	O
,	O
there	O
are	O
strong	O
ministerial	O
voices	O
arguing	O
-	O
for	O
example	O
-	O
that	O
an	O
EU-wide	O
interest	O
rate	O
could	O
leave	O
higher	O
taxes	O
or	O
spending	O
cuts	O
as	O
the	O
only	O
inflation-fighting	O
weapon	O
,	O
thus	O
jeopardising	O
all	O
Labour	B-ORG
's	O
promises	O
-	O
an	O
argument	O
that	O
could	O
resurface	O
in	O
a	O
referendum	O
.	O

Secondly	O
,	O
euro-entry	O
is	O
not	O
exactly	O
a	O
priority	O
for	O
other	O
Cabinet	O
ministers	O
.	O

Focused	O
on	O
their	O
departments	O
,	O
they	O
are	O
n't	O
yet	O
geared	O
up	O
for	O
the	O
fight	O

But	O
the	O
big	O
caveat	O
is	O
Mr	O
Brown	B-PER
.	O

Whether	O
and	O
how	O
he	O
moves	O
from	O
his	O
present	O
deep	O
caution	O
remains	O
the	O
most	O
fascinating	O
question	O
in	O
British	O
politics	O
.	O

By	O
all	O
accounts	O
,	O
the	O
Big	O
Meeting	O
between	O
the	O
two	O
is	O
yet	O
to	O
happen	O
.	O

But	O
while	O
Mr	O
Blair	B-PER
-	O
whose	O
enthusiasm	O
is	O
well	O
attested	O
-	O
is	O
a	O
necessary	O
condition	O
,	O
he	O
is	O
not	O
sufficient	O
.	O

Now	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
the	O
Chancellor	O
who	O
is	O
both	O
a	O
necessary	O
and	O
sufficient	O
condition	O
for	O
entry	O
.	O

There	O
is	O
a	O
link	O
between	O
all	O
this	O
and	O
Mr	O
Straw	B-PER
's	O
speech	O
,	O
even	O
though	O
he	O
will	O
not	O
dwell	O
on	O
the	O
euro	O
.	O

Firstly	O
,	O
because	O
a	O
Europe	B-LOC
on	O
the	O
lines	O
that	O
he	O
will	O
suggest	O
could	O
make	O
euro-entry	O
more	O
congenial	O
to	O
the	O
doubters	O
.	O

But	O
,	O
secondly	O
,	O
because	O
he	O
will	O
offer	O
a	O
robust	O
defence	O
of	O
the	O
EU	B-ORG
and	O
of	O
pooling	O
sovereignty	O
to	O
achieve	O
domestic	O
goals	O
.	O

But	O
that	O
should	O
not	O
disguise	O
the	O
central	O
fact	O
.	O

The	O
key	O
issue	O
is	O
no	O
longer	O
so	O
much	O
one	O
of	O
agonising	O
over	O
whether	O
the	O
British	O
people	O
can	O
wear	O
it	O
but	O
of	O
what	O
is	O
the	O
dynamic	O
within	O
the	O
Government	B-ORG
.	O

There	O
are	O
more	O
important	O
things	O
in	O
life	O
than	O
Cate	B-PER
Blanchett	I-PER
's	O
breasts	O
,	O
but	O
not	O
many	O
.	O

All	O
the	O
Australian	O
film	O
star	O
had	O
to	O
do	O
was	O
turn	O
up	O
at	O
the	O

the	O
column	O

filled	O
up	O
as	O

by	O
magic	O

Admittedly	O
Blanchett	B-PER
was	O
wearing	O
a	O
nice	O
frock	O

unlike	O
most	O
of	O
the	O

took	O

in	O
London	B-LOC

and	O
a	O

were	O
two	O
of	O
this	O

's	O
highlights	O
-	O
but	O
a	O
photograph	O
of	O
her	O
cupping	O
her	O
breasts	O
was	O
enough	O
to	O
prompt	O
fevered	O
speculation	O
.	O

Had	O
Blanchett	B-PER
dropped	O
a	O
cup	O

to	O
speak	O

as	O
a	O

of	O

The	O
film	O
's	O
producers	O
must	O
have	O
been	O
delighted	O

as	O
their	O
star	O
effortlessly	O
extended	O
the	O
free	O

they	O

already	O
received	O

The	O
contemporary	O
fascination	O
with	O

is	O
a	O
gift	O
to	O
anyone	O
who	O
has	O
something	O
to	O
sell	O
.	O

At	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
a	O
strange	O
feature	O
of	O
a	O
culture	O
that	O
could	O
reasonably	O
be	O
described	O
as	O
obsessed	O
with	O
breasts	O
that	O
we	O
seem	O
to	O
know	O
very	O
little	O
about	O
them	O
.	O

I	O
have	O
not	O
had	O
children	O

I	O

It	O
may	O
be	O
that	O

in	O
an	O
era	O
when	O
women	O
's	O
breasts	O
swell	O
and	O
shrink	O
on	O
the	O
tables	O
of	O

,	O
we	O
have	O
forgotten	O
that	O
changes	O
in	O

are	O
a	O
natural	O
phenomenon	O

To	O
be	O
fair	O
,	O
almost	O
as	O

excitement	O
was	O
generated	O
last	O

by	O
Kylie	B-PER

In	O
recent	O

,	O
columnists	O
have	O
been	O
wheeled	O
out	O
to	O
explain	O
why	O
we	O
like	O
Kylie	B-PER
so	O
much	O
more	O
than	O
Britney	B-PER

;	O
she	O
has	O
even	O
been	O
hailed	O
as	O
a	O
symbol	O
of	O
everything	O
the	O
Taliban	B-ORG
hated	O
about	O
the	O
modern	O

This	O
is	O
quite	O
a	O
weight	O
for	O
Minogue	B-PER
's	O
diminutive	O
frame	O
to	O
bear	O
and	O
it	O
suggests	O
that	O
the	O

are	O
on	O

,	O
the	O
more	O
they	O
need	O
explaining	O
and	O
decoding	O

Of	O
course	O
this	O
is	O
something	O
to	O
do	O
with	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
most	O
women	O
do	O
n't	O
look	O
like	O
Blanchett	B-PER
or	O
Minogue	B-PER
,	O
and	O
tend	O
to	O
be	O
in	O
a	O
state	O
of	O
permanent	O
anxiety	O
about	O
their	O
appearance	O

We	O
no	O
longer	O
know	O
what	O
``	O
natural	O
''	O
women	O
look	O

but	O
movie	O

no	O
more	O

the	O

women	O
who	O
are	O
involved	O
in	O
a	O
daily	O
struggle	O
to	O
control	O
their	O

In	O
that	O
sense	O

even	O
the	O
most	O

become	O
a	O

this	O

when	O
Peter	B-PER
Jackson	I-PER
's	O

of	O
The	O

was	O
released	O

sceptical	O

such	O
as	O
Mark	B-PER
Lawson	I-PER
,	O
Thomas	B-PER
Sutcliffe	I-PER
and	O
David	B-PER

poured	O
scorn	O
on	O
people	O
who	O
took	O
their	O
childish	O
delights	O
into	O
adulthood	O
.	O

They	O
seem	O
to	O
believe	O
that	O
people	O
who	O
sink	O
into	O
tales	O
that	O
shrug	O
off	O
the	O

But	O
these	O
critics	O

are	O
proud	O
to	O
be	O

to	O
enjoy	O
a	O
book	O
where	O
a	O
bear	O
talks	O
or	O
a	O
dragon	O

might	O
be	O
missing	O

They	O
need	O
n't	O
be	O
afraid	O
that	O
they	O
will	O
lose	O
their	O
critical	O
edge	O
if	O
they	O
let	O
down	O

guard	O
against	O
childish	O
things	O
for	O
an	O
instant	O

Do	O
we	O
still	O
have	O
to	O
spell	O
it	O
out	O

It	O
really	O
is	O
possible	O
to	O

and	O
Roth	B-PER
,	O
to	O
enjoy	O
Pullman	B-PER
as	O
well	O
as	O
Proust	B-PER
.	O

What	O
is	O
endearing	O
about	O
the	O
new	O
breed	O
of	O
children	O
's	O
writers	O
is	O
that	O
they	O
are	O
firing	O
a	O
new	O
bolt	O
of	O
energy	O
into	O
literature	O
.	O

Nave	O
?	O

Yes	O
,	O
they	O
may	O
be	O
nave	O
.	O

But	O
what	O
they	O
do	O
n't	O
suffer	O
from	O
is	O
the	O
deadening	O
claustrophobia	O
of	O
so	O
much	O
acclaimed	O
literature	O
for	O
grown-ups	O
.	O

Readers	O
who	O
fell	O
on	O
hyped	O
novels	O
such	O
as	O
Jonathan	B-PER

's	O
The	O
Corrections	O
or	O
Margaret	B-PER
Atwood	I-PER
's	O
The	O
Blind	O

only	O
to	O
find	O
them	O
imaginatively	O
underpowered	O
,	O
will	O
know	O
what	O
I	O
mean	O
when	O
I	O
say	O
that	O
even	O
the	O
biggest	O
novels	O
today	O
can	O
seem	O
much	O
smaller	O
than	O
life	O
.	O

Still	O
,	O
perhaps	O
those	O
novels	O
honestly	O
reflect	O
the	O
problematic	O
aspects	O
of	O
our	O
current	O
condition	O
,	O
whereas	O
the	O
children	O
's	O
writers	O
have	O
the	O
liberty	O
of	O
escapism	O
.	O

That	O
may	O
be	O
TRUE	O
.	O

But	O
sometimes	O
it	O
is	O
worth	O
going	O
on	O
these	O
journeys	O
-	O
not	O
just	O
to	O
escape	O
,	O
but	O
also	O
to	O
return	O

I	O
'm	O
sure	O
I	O
'm	O
not	O
alone	O
in	O
saying	O
that	O
after	O
stepping	O

or	O
into	O
Pullman	B-PER
's	O
world	O

thrive	O
on	O
the	O
staggeringly	O
precise	O
and	O
sensual	O
detailing	O
of	O

,	O
I	O
found	O
that	O

Without	O

they	O
do	O
lack	O
other	O
qualities	O
that	O
you	O
look	O
for	O
in	O
literature	O
that	O
is	O
n't	O
meant	O
for	O
children	O
.	O

But	O
still	O
,	O
Rowling	B-PER
and	O
Pullman	B-PER
can	O
achieve	O
that	O
precious	O
effect	O
on	O
the	O
reader	O
of	O
tearing	O
away	O
the	O
veils	O
of	O
familiarity	O
and	O
reawakening	O
one	O
to	O
the	O
oddness	O

of	O

an	O
often	O

this	O

was	O

Now	O
,	O
amazingly	O

it	O
turns	O
out	O
that	O
this	O
might	O
actually	O
be	O
TRUE	O
!	O

I	O
never	O
expected	O
that	O
.	O

Of	O
course	O

the	O
fact	O
is	O
that	O
these	O
numbers	O

I	O
have	O

bragging	O
about	O
would	O
be	O
considered	O
totally	O

of	O
the	O

that	O
I	O
've	O
been	O
involved	O
in	O
,	O
but	O
in	O
publishing	O
these	O
numbers	O
denote	O
a	O
major	O
smash	O
hit	O
,	O
partly	O
because	O
very	O
few	O
people	O
buy	O
collections	O
of	O
short	O
stories	O
.	O

I	O
think	O
I	O
have	O
finally	O
found	O
the	O
artistic	O
field	O
that	O
I	O
should	O
be	O
in	O
,	O
a	O
field	O
where	O
tiny	O
numbers	O
still	O
denote	O
huge	O
success	O
,	O
where	O
the	O
minuscule	O
number	O
of	O
twisted	O
,	O
supercilious	O
malcontents	O
who	O
find	O

funny	O
can	O

Once	O
I	O
might	O
have	O
sneered	O
at	O
this	O
,	O
but	O
my	O
sense	O
now	O
,	O
which	O
has	O
been	O
arrived	O
at	O
over	O
years	O
of	O
an	O
up-and-down	O

,	O
is	O
that	O
success	O
is	O
success	O
,	O
and	O
whatever	O
denotes	O
success	O
makes	O
you	O
feel	O
much	O
better	O
and	O
if	O
you	O
are	O
feeling	O
good	O
about	O
yourself	O
that	O
feeling	O
is	O
reflected	O
in	O
numerous	O
ways	O

I	O
remember	O
years	O
ago	O
that	O
I	O
visited	O
a	O
restaurant	O
in	O
Covent	B-LOC
Garden	I-LOC
with	O
Lenny	B-PER
Henry	I-PER

We	O
had	O
just	O
done	O
a	O
TV	O
show	O
together	O
called	O
OTT	O
which	O
had	O
caused	O
a	O
big	O
furore	O
and	O
had	O
been	O
a	O
disaster	O
so	O
big	O
that	O
I	O
'd	O
returned	O
from	O
Birmingham	B-LOC
where	O
the	O
show	O
was	O
made	O
with	O
somebody	O
else	O
's	O
tail	O
between	O
my	O
legs	O
.	O

This	O
restaurant	O
we	O
went	O
to	O
made	O
a	O
big	O
deal	O
of	O
its	O
visitors	O
'	O
book	O
,	O
which	O
they	O
nagged	O
me	O
into	O
signing	O

A	O
few	O
years	O
later	O
I	O
happened	O
to	O
revisit	O
this	O
place	O
at	O
a	O
time	O
when	O
I	O
had	O
my	O
own	O
hit	O
television	O
series	O
and	O
was	O
feeling	O
on	O
top	O
of	O
the	O
world	O
with	O
a	O
string	O
of	O
awards	O
and	O
massive	O

Flipping	O
back	O
through	O
the	O
pages	O
of	O
the	O
restaurant	O

book	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
able	O
to	O
compare	O
my	O

,	O
then	O
and	O
now	O

Looking	O
back	O
at	O
the	O
first	O
it	O
was	O
tiny	O
,	O
crabbed	O
,	O
tentative	O
and	O
spidery	O
reflecting	O
my	O
feeble	O
doubting	O
inner	O

for	O
some	O
reason	O

on	O
my	O

I	O
do	O

,	O
because	O
I	O
am	O
such	O
a	O
big	O

an	O

I	O
will	O
be	O

I	O
think	O
it	O
's	O
a	O
good	O
time	O
to	O
leave	O
newspaper	O
writing	O
for	O
a	O
while	O

it	O
's	O

's	O
anything	O
much	O
going	O
on	O
in	O
the	O
world	O
to	O
write	O
about	O
.	O

Sometimes	O
,	O
you	O
really	O
have	O
to	O
scratch	O
your	O
head	O
a	O
bit	O
.	O

The	O
economic	O
data	O
have	O
signalled	O
generally	O
upbeat	O
news	O
.	O

Industrial	O
surveys	O
are	O
consistently	O
pointing	O
to	O
recovery	O
,	O
even	O
if	O
actual	O
growth	O
in	O
the	O
second	O
half	O
of	O
2001	O
was	O
rather	O
disappointing	O
.	O

Yet	O
the	O
financial	O
markets	O
remain	O
very	O
sceptical	O
,	O
with	O
equities	O
lower	O
relative	O
to	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
last	O
year	O
.	O

Meanwhile	O
,	O
Messrs	O
Greenspan	B-PER
and	O
George	B-PER
are	O
prepared	O
only	O
to	O
be	O
cautiously	O
optimistic	O
.	O

Yes	O
,	O
the	O
worst	O
may	O
now	O
be	O
behind	O
us	O
.	O

But	O
,	O
no	O
,	O
there	O
can	O
be	O
no	O
guarantees	O
of	O
a	O
rapid	O
return	O
to	O
buoyant	O
-	O
and	O
,	O
perhaps	O
,	O
more	O
importantly	O
-	O
sustainable	O
economic	O
growth	O
.	O

What	O
should	O
we	O
make	O
of	O
these	O
cross	O
currents	O
?	O

There	O
are	O
one	O
or	O
two	O
reasonably	O
straightforward	O
conclusions	O
.	O

First	O
,	O
it	O
's	O
pretty	O
clear	O
,	O
even	O
with	O
a	O
recovery	O
,	O
there	O
is	O
no	O
immediate	O
risk	O
of	O
a	O
return	O
to	O
higher	O
interest	O
rates	O
.	O

If	O
there	O
are	O
doubts	O
about	O
the	O
sustainability	O
of	O
economic	O
growth	O
,	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
a	O
bit	O
odd	O
to	O
take	O
the	O
risk	O
of	O
raising	O
interest	O
rates	O
only	O
to	O
be	O
blamed	O
for	O
creating	O
a	O
subsequent	O
``	O
double-dip	O
''	O
.	O

Knee-jerk	O
financial	O
market	O
reactions	O
that	O
point	O
to	O
higher	O
interest	O
rates	O
at	O
the	O
first	O
sign	O
of	O
recovery	O
should	O
,	O
therefore	O
,	O
be	O
dismissed	O
.	O

Second	O
,	O
if	O
the	O
recovery	O
is	O
ultimately	O
constrained	O
,	O
the	O
inflationary	O
outlook	O
should	O
be	O
subdued	O
for	O
a	O
prolonged	O
period	O
of	O
time	O
.	O

Indeed	O
,	O
to	O
the	O
extent	O
that	O
activity	O
levels	O
remain	O
below	O
where	O
they	O
should	O
be	O
-	O
either	O
because	O
unemployment	O
is	O
too	O
high	O
or	O
because	O
there	O
's	O
plenty	O
of	O
spare	O
capacity	O
-	O
there	O
's	O
a	O
good	O
chance	O
that	O
inflation	O
may	O
undershoot	O
central	O
bank	O
targets	O
.	O

This	O
leads	O
to	O
some	O
interesting	O
results	O
.	O

At	O
the	O
Bank	B-ORG
of	I-ORG
England	I-ORG
,	O
for	O
example	O
,	O
the	O
corridors	O
are	O
still	O
echoing	O
more	O
to	O
the	O
sound	O
of	O
cooing	O
doves	O
than	O
screeching	O
hawks	O
.	O

Underneath	O
all	O
of	O
this	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
is	O
an	O
issue	O
about	O
recession	O
and	O
recovery	O
.	O

If	O
the	O
recession	O
is	O
shallow	O
,	O
what	O
does	O
this	O
say	O
about	O
the	O
subsequent	O
recovery	O
?	O

This	O
is	O
a	O
key	O
question	O
for	O
policy	O
makers	O
today	O
.	O

The	O
downswing	O
through	O
the	O
course	O
of	O
2001	O
proved	O
to	O
be	O
relatively	O
mild	O
.	O

Indeed	O
,	O
as	O
Alan	B-PER
Greenspan	I-PER
said	O
in	O
his	O
testimony	O
before	O
Congress	O
last	O
week	O
,	O
``	O
the	O
recuperative	O
powers	O

been	O
remarkable	O
''	O
.	O

Clearly	O
,	O
Mr	O
Greenspan	B-PER
is	O
hopeful	O
that	O
the	O
worst	O
is	O
now	O
over	O
and	O
,	O
certainly	O
from	O
a	O
data	O
perspective	O
,	O
there	O
has	O
been	O
plenty	O
of	O

Yet	O
he	O
is	O
never	O
one	O
to	O
have	O
his	O

it	O

Although	O
the	O

did	O

feared	O
in	O
the	O

for	O

be	O
to	O
convince	O
