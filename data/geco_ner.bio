the	O

John	B-PER

Mrs.	B-PER

me	O
some	O

Mrs.	B-PER

The	O
French	O
window	O
swung	O
open	O
a	O
little	O
wider	O

and	O
a	O
handsome	O
white-haired	O
old	O
lady	O

with	O
a	O
somewhat	O

cast	O

A	O

in	O

manner	O

Mrs.	B-PER
Inglethorp	I-PER
greeted	O
me	O
with	O
effusion	O

Why	O
,	O
if	O
it	O
is	O
n't	O
too	O
delightful	O
to	O
see	O
you	O
again	O
,	O
Mr.	B-PER

,	O
after	O
all	O
these	O

Alfred	B-PER
,	O

,	O
Mr.	B-PER
Hastings	I-PER
...	O
my	O
husband	O
.	O

I	O
looked	O
with	O
some	O
curiosity	O
at	O
`	O
Alfred	B-PER
darling	O
'	O
.	O

He	O
certainly	O
struck	O
a	O
rather	O
alien	O
note	O
.	O

I	O
did	O
not	O
wonder	O
at	O
John	B-PER
objecting	O
to	O
his	O
beard	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
longest	O
and	O
blackest	O
I	O
have	O
ever	O
seen	O
.	O

He	O
wore	O
gold-rimmed	O
pince-nez	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
a	O
curious	O
impassivity	O
of	O
feature	O
.	O

It	O
struck	O
me	O
that	O
he	O
might	O
look	O
natural	O
on	O
a	O
stage	O
,	O
but	O
was	O
strangely	O
out	O
of	O
place	O
in	O
real	O
life	O
.	O

His	O
voice	O
was	O
rather	O
deep	O
and	O
unctuous	O
.	O

He	O
placed	O
a	O
wooden	O
hand	O
in	O
mine	O
and	O
said	O
:	O
This	O
is	O
a	O
pleasure	O
,	O
Mr.	B-PER
Hastings	I-PER
.	O

Then	O
,	O
turning	O
to	O
his	O
wife	O
:	O
Emily	B-PER
dearest	O
,	O
I	O
think	O
that	O
cushion	O
is	O
a	O
little	O
damp	O
.	O

She	O
beamed	O
fondly	O
on	O
him	O
,	O
as	O
he	O
substituted	O
another	O
with	O
every	O
demonstration	O
of	O
the	O
tenderest	O
care	O
.	O

Strange	O
infatuation	O
of	O
an	O
otherwise	O
sensible	O
woman	O
!	O

With	O
the	O
presence	O
of	O
Mr.	B-PER
Inglethorp	I-PER
,	O
a	O
sense	O
of	O
constraint	O
and	O
veiled	O
hostility	O
seemed	O
to	O
settle	O
down	O
upon	O
the	O
company	O
.	O

Miss	B-PER
Howard	I-PER
,	O
in	O
particular	O
,	O
took	O
no	O
pains	O
to	O
conceal	O
her	O
feelings	O
.	O

Mrs.	B-PER
Inglethorp	I-PER
,	O
however	O
,	O
seemed	O
to	O
notice	O
nothing	O
unusual	O
.	O

Her	O
volubility	O
,	O
which	O
I	O
remembered	O
of	O
old	O
,	O
had	O
lost	O
nothing	O
in	O
the	O
intervening	O
years	O
,	O
and	O
she	O
poured	O
out	O
a	O
steady	O
flood	O
of	O
conversation	O
,	O
mainly	O
on	O
the	O
subject	O
of	O
the	O
forthcoming	O
bazaar	O
which	O
she	O
was	O
organizing	O
and	O
which	O
was	O
to	O
take	O
place	O
shortly	O
.	O

Occasionally	O
she	O
referred	O
to	O
her	O
husband	O
over	O
a	O
question	O
of	O
days	O
or	O
dates	O
.	O

His	O
watchful	O
and	O
attentive	O
manner	O
never	O
varied	O
.	O

From	O
the	O
very	O
first	O
I	O
took	O
a	O
firm	O
and	O
rooted	O
dislike	O
to	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
flatter	O
myself	O
that	O
my	O
first	O
judgments	O
are	O
usually	O
fairly	O
shrewd	O
.	O

Presently	O
Mrs.	B-PER
Inglethorp	I-PER
turned	O
to	O
give	O
some	O
instructions	O
about	O
letters	O
to	O
Evelyn	B-PER
Howard	I-PER
,	O
and	O
her	O
husband	O
addressed	O
me	O
in	O
his	O
painstaking	O

:	O

I	O

a	O
very	O

he	O
quite	O

me	O

He	O
was	O
a	O
marvellous	O
little	O

He	O
used	O
to	O
say	O
that	O
all	O

For	O
the	O
first	O
time	O
I	O
felt	O
that	O
,	O
with	O
Evelyn	B-PER
Howard	I-PER
,	O
something	O
indefinable	O
had	O
gone	O
from	O
the	O
atmosphere	O
.	O

Her	O
presence	O
had	O
spelt	O
security	O
.	O

Now	O
that	O
security	O
was	O
removed	O
...	O
and	O
the	O
air	O
seemed	O
rife	O
with	O
suspicion	O
.	O

The	O
sinister	O
face	O
of	O
Dr	B-PER
Bauerstein	I-PER
recurred	O
to	O
me	O
unpleasantly	O
.	O

A	O
vague	O
suspicion	O
of	O
every	O
one	O
and	O
everything	O
filled	O
my	O
mind	O
.	O

Just	O
for	O
a	O
moment	O
I	O
had	O
a	O
premonition	O
of	O
approaching	O
evil	O
.	O

I	O
had	O
arrived	O
at	O
Styles	B-LOC
on	O
the	O
5th	O
of	O
July	O
.	O

I	O
come	O
now	O
to	O
the	O
events	O
of	O
the	O
16th	O
and	O
17th	O
of	O
that	O
month	O

For	O
the	O
convenience	O
of	O
the	O
reader	O
I	O
will	O
recapitulate	O
the	O
incidents	O
of	O
those	O
days	O
in	O
as	O
exact	O
a	O
manner	O
as	O
possible	O
.	O

They	O
were	O
elicited	O
subsequently	O
at	O
the	O
trial	O
by	O
a	O
process	O
of	O
long	O
and	O
tedious	O
cross-examinations	O

I	O
received	O
a	O
letter	O
from	O
Evelyn	B-PER
Howard	I-PER
a	O
couple	O
of	O
days	O
after	O
her	O
departure	O
,	O
telling	O
me	O
she	O
was	O
working	O
as	O
a	O
nurse	O
at	O
the	O
big	O
hospital	O
in	O
Middlingham	B-LOC
,	O
a	O
manufacturing	O
town	O
some	O
fifteen	O
miles	O
away	O
,	O
and	O
begging	O
me	O
to	O
let	O
her	O
know	O
if	O
Mrs.	B-PER
Inglethorp	I-PER
should	O
show	O
any	O
wish	O
to	O
be	O
reconciled	O

The	O
only	O
fly	O
in	O
the	O
ointment	O
of	O
my	O
peaceful	O
days	O
was	O
Mrs.	B-PER
Cavendish	I-PER
's	O
extraordinary	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
for	O
my	O
part	O
,	O
unaccountable	O
preference	O
for	O
the	O
society	O
of	O
Dr	B-PER
Bauerstein	I-PER
.	O

What	O
she	O
saw	O
in	O
the	O
man	O
I	O
can	O
not	O
imagine	O
,	O
but	O
she	O
was	O
always	O
asking	O
him	O
up	O
to	O
the	O
house	O
,	O
and	O
often	O
went	O
off	O
for	O
long	O
expeditions	O
with	O
him	O
.	O

I	O
must	O
confess	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
quite	O
unable	O
to	O
see	O
his	O
attraction	O
.	O

The	O
16th	O
of	O
July	O
fell	O
on	O
a	O
Monday	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
a	O
day	O
of	O
turmoil	O
.	O

The	O
famous	O
bazaar	O
had	O
taken	O
place	O
on	O
Saturday	O
,	O
and	O
an	O
entertainment	O
,	O
in	O
connection	O
with	O
the	O
same	O
charity	O
,	O
at	O
which	O
Mrs.	B-PER
Inglethorp	I-PER
was	O
to	O
recite	O
a	O
War	O
poem	O
,	O
was	O
to	O
be	O
held	O
that	O
night	O
.	O

We	O
were	O
all	O
busy	O
during	O
the	O
morning	O
arranging	O
and	O
decorating	O
the	O
Hall	O
in	O
the	O
village	O
where	O
it	O
was	O
to	O
take	O
place	O

We	O
had	O
a	O
late	O
luncheon	O
and	O
spent	O
the	O
afternoon	O
resting	O
in	O
the	O
garden	O
.	O

I	O
noticed	O
that	O
John	B-PER
's	O
manner	O
was	O
somewhat	O
unusual	O
.	O

He	O
seemed	O
very	O
excited	O
and	O
restless	O
.	O

After	O
tea	O
,	O
Mrs.	B-PER
Inglethorp	I-PER
went	O
to	O
lie	O
down	O
to	O
rest	O
before	O
her	O
efforts	O
in	O
the	O
evening	O
and	O
I	O
challenged	O
Mary	B-PER
Cavendish	I-PER
to	O
a	O
single	O
at	O
tennis	O
.	O

About	O
a	O
quarter	O
to	O
seven	O
,	O
Mrs.	B-PER
Inglethorp	I-PER
called	O
us	O
that	O
we	O
should	O
be	O
late	O
as	O
supper	O
was	O
early	O
that	O
night	O
.	O

``	O
We	O
had	O
rather	O
a	O

to	O
get	O
ready	O
in	O
time	O
;	O

before	O
the	O
meal	O
was	O
over	O
the	O
motor	O

at	O
the	O

The	O
entertainment	O
was	O
a	O
great	O
success	O
,	O
Mrs.	B-PER
Inglethorp	I-PER
's	O
recitation	O
receiving	O
tremendous	O
applause	O
.	O

There	O
were	O
also	O
some	O
tableaux	O
in	O
which	O
Cynthia	B-PER
took	O
part	O
.	O

She	O
did	O
not	O
return	O
with	O
us	O

having	O
been	O
asked	O
to	O
a	O

Mrs.	B-PER

she	O
was	O
rather	O
overtired	O

swept	O
Lawrence	B-PER

off	O
to	O
a	O
luncheon	O

Such	O
a	O
charming	O
invitation	O
from	O
Mrs.	B-PER
Rolleston	I-PER

Lady	B-PER
Tadminster	I-PER

The	O
Rollestons	B-PER
came	O
over	O
with	O
the	O
Conqueror	O
...	O
one	O
of	O
our	O
oldest	O
families	O

Mary	B-PER
had	O
excused	O
herself	O
on	O
the	O
plea	O
of	O
an	O
engagement	O
with	O
Dr	B-PER
Bauerstein	I-PER
.	O

We	O
had	O
a	O
pleasant	O
luncheon	O
,	O
and	O
as	O
we	O
drove	O
away	O
Lawrence	B-PER
suggested	O
that	O
we	O
should	O
return	O
by	O
Tadminster	B-LOC
,	O
which	O
was	O
barely	O
a	O
mile	O
out	O
of	O
our	O
way	O
,	O
and	O
pay	O
a	O
visit	O
to	O
Cynthia	B-PER
in	O
her	O
dispensary	O
.	O

Mrs.	B-PER
Inglethorp	I-PER
replied	O
that	O
this	O
was	O
an	O
excellent	O
idea	O
,	O
but	O
as	O
she	O
had	O
several	O
letters	O
to	O
write	O
she	O
would	O
drop	O
us	O
there	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
could	O
come	O
back	O
with	O
Cynthia	B-PER
in	O
the	O
pony-trap	O
.	O

We	O
were	O
detained	O
under	O
suspicion	O
by	O
the	O
hospital	O
porter	O
,	O
until	O
Cynthia	B-PER
appeared	O
to	O
vouch	O
for	O
us	O
,	O
looking	O
very	O
cool	O
and	O
sweet	O
in	O
her	O
long	O
white	O
overall	O
.	O

She	O
took	O
us	O
up	O
to	O
her	O
sanctum	O
,	O
and	O
introduced	O
us	O
to	O
her	O
fellow	O
dispenser	O
,	O
a	O
rather	O
awe-inspiring	O
individual	O
,	O
whom	O
Cynthia	B-PER
cheerily	O
addressed	O
as	O
`	O
Nibs	O
'	O
.	O

What	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
bottles	O
!	O

I	O
exclaimed	O
,	O
as	O
my	O
eye	O
travelled	O
round	O
the	O
small	O
room	O
.	O

Do	O
you	O
really	O
know	O
what	O
's	O
in	O
them	O
all	O
?	O

Say	O
something	O
original	O
,	O
groaned	O
Cynthia	B-PER
.	O

Every	O
single	O
person	O
who	O
comes	O
up	O
here	O
says	O
that	O
.	O

We	O
are	O
really	O
thinking	O
of	O
bestowing	O
a	O
prize	O
on	O
the	O
first	O

who	O
does	O
not	O
say	O
:	O
`	O
What	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
bottles	O
!	O
'	O

And	O
I	O
know	O
the	O
next	O
thing	O
you	O
're	O
going	O
to	O
say	O
is	O
:	O
`	O
How	O
many	O
people	O
have	O
you	O
poisoned	O
?	O
'	O

I	O
pleaded	O
guilty	O
with	O
a	O
laugh	O
.	O

If	O
you	O
people	O
only	O
knew	O
how	O
fatally	O
easy	O
it	O
is	O
to	O
poison	O
some	O
one	O
by	O
mistake	O
,	O
you	O
would	O
n't	O
joke	O
about	O
it	O

Come	O
on	O
,	O
let	O
's	O
have	O
tea	O

We	O
've	O
got	O
all	O
sorts	O
of	O
secret	O
stories	O
in	O
that	O
cupboard	O

No	O

Lawrence	B-PER
...	O
that	O

the	O
poison	O
cupboard	O

The	O
big	O
cupboard	O
...	O
that	O
's	O
right	O

We	O
had	O
a	O
very	O
cheery	O
tea	O
,	O
and	O
assisted	O
Cynthia	B-PER
to	O
wash	O
up	O
afterwards	O
.	O

We	O
had	O
just	O
put	O
away	O
the	O
last	O
tea-spoon	O
when	O
a	O
knock	O
came	O
at	O
the	O
door	O
.	O

The	O
countenances	O
of	O
Cynthia	B-PER
and	O
Nibs	O
were	O
suddenly	O
petrified	O
into	O
a	O
stern	O
and	O
forbidding	O
expression	O
.	O

Come	O
in	O
,	O
said	O
Cynthia	B-PER
,	O
in	O
a	O
sharp	O
professional	O
tone	O
.	O

A	O
young	O
and	O
rather	O
scared	O
looking	O
nurse	O
appeared	O
with	O
a	O
bottle	O
which	O
she	O
proffered	O
to	O
Nibs	O
,	O
who	O
waved	O
her	O
towards	O
Cynthia	B-PER
with	O
the	O
somewhat	O
enigmatical	O
remark	O
:	O
I	O
'm	O
not	O
really	O
here	O
today	O
.	O

Cynthia	B-PER
took	O
the	O
bottle	O
and	O
examined	O
it	O
with	O
the	O
severity	O
of	O
a	O
judge	O
.	O

This	O
should	O
have	O
been	O
sent	O
up	O
this	O
morning	O
.	O

Sister	O
is	O
very	O
sorry	O
.	O

She	O
forgot	O
.	O

Sister	O
should	O
read	O
the	O
rules	O
outside	O
the	O
door	O
.	O

I	O
gathered	O
from	O
the	O
little	O
nurse	O
's	O
expression	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
not	O
the	O
least	O
likelihood	O
of	O
her	O
having	O
the	O
hardihood	O
to	O
retail	O
this	O
message	O
to	O
the	O
dreaded	O
`	O
Sister	O
'	O
.	O

So	O
now	O
it	O
ca	O
n't	O
be	O
done	O
until	O
tomorrow	O
,	O
finished	O
Cynthia	B-PER
.	O

Do	O
n't	O
you	O
think	O
you	O
could	O
possibly	O
let	O
us	O
have	O
it	O
tonight	O
?	O

Well	O
,	O
said	O
Cynthia	B-PER
graciously	O
,	O
we	O
are	O
very	O
busy	O
,	O
but	O
if	O
we	O
have	O
time	O
it	O
shall	O
be	O
done	O
.	O

The	O
little	O
nurse	O
withdrew	O
,	O
and	O
Cynthia	B-PER
promptly	O
took	O
a	O
jar	O
from	O
the	O
shelf	O
,	O
refilled	O
the	O
bottle	O
,	O
and	O
placed	O
it	O
on	O
the	O
table	O
outside	O
the	O
door	O
.	O

I	O
laughed	O
.	O

Discipline	O
must	O
be	O
maintained	O
?	O

Exactly	O
.	O

Come	O
out	O
on	O
our	O
little	O
balcony	O
.	O

You	O
can	O
see	O
all	O
the	O
outside	O
wards	O
there	O
.	O

I	O
followed	O
Cynthia	B-PER
and	O
her	O
friend	O
and	O
they	O
pointed	O
out	O
the	O
different	O
wards	O
to	O
me	O
.	O

Lawrence	B-PER
remained	O
behind	O
,	O
but	O
after	O
a	O
few	O
moments	O
Cynthia	B-PER
called	O
to	O
him	O
over	O
her	O
shoulder	O
to	O
come	O
and	O
join	O
us	O
.	O

Then	O
she	O
looked	O
at	O
her	O
watch	O
.	O

Nothing	O
more	O
to	O
do	O
,	O
Nibs	O
?	O

No	O
.	O

All	O
right	O
.	O

Then	O
we	O
can	O
lock	O
up	O
and	O
go	O
.	O

I	O
had	O
seen	O
Lawrence	B-PER
in	O
quite	O
a	O
different	O
light	O
that	O
afternoon	O
.	O

Compared	O
to	O
John	B-PER
,	O
he	O
was	O
an	O
astoundingly	O
difficult	O
person	O
to	O
get	O
to	O
know	O
.	O

He	O
was	O
the	O
opposite	O
of	O
his	O
brother	O
in	O
almost	O
every	O
respect	O
,	O
being	O
unusually	O
shy	O
and	O
reserved	O
.	O

Yet	O
he	O
had	O
a	O
certain	O
charm	O
of	O
manner	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
fancied	O
that	O
,	O
if	O
one	O
really	O
knew	O
him	O
well	O
,	O
one	O
could	O
have	O
a	O
deep	O
affection	O
for	O
him	O
.	O

I	O
had	O
always	O
fancied	O
that	O
his	O
manner	O
to	O
Cynthia	B-PER
was	O
rather	O
constrained	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
she	O
on	O
her	O
side	O
was	O
inclined	O
to	O
be	O
shy	O
of	O
him	O
.	O

But	O
they	O
were	O
both	O
gay	O
enough	O
this	O
afternoon	O
,	O
and	O
chatted	O
together	O
like	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
children	O
.	O

As	O
we	O
drove	O
through	O
the	O
village	O
,	O
I	O
remembered	O
that	O
I	O
wanted	O
some	O
stamps	O
,	O
so	O
accordingly	O
we	O
pulled	O
up	O
at	O
the	O
post	O
office	O
.	O

As	O
I	O
came	O
out	O
again	O
,	O
I	O
cannoned	O
into	O
a	O
little	O
man	O
who	O
was	O
just	O
entering	O
.	O

I	O
drew	O
aside	O
and	O
apologised	O
,	O
when	O
suddenly	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
loud	O
exclamation	O
,	O
he	O
clasped	O
me	O
in	O
his	O
arms	O
and	O
kissed	O
me	O
warmly	O
.	O

Mon	O
ami	O
Hastings	B-PER

he	O
cried	O

It	O
is	O
indeed	O

I	O
exclaimed	O

I	O
turned	O
to	O
the	O
pony-trap	O

This	O
is	O
a	O
very	O
pleasant	O
meeting	O
for	O

Cynthia	B-PER
gaily	O
.	O

But	O
I	O
had	O
no	O
idea	O
he	O
was	O
a	O
friend	O
of	O
yours	O
.	O

Yes	O
,	O
indeed	O
,	O
said	O
Poirot	B-PER
seriously	O
.	O

I	O
know	O
Mademoiselle	B-PER
Cynthia	I-PER
.	O

It	O
is	O
by	O
the	O
charity	O
of	O
that	O
good	O
Mrs.	B-PER
Inglethorp	I-PER
that	O
I	O
am	O
here	O
.	O

Then	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
looked	O
at	O
him	O
inquiringly	O
:	O
Yes	O
,	O
my	O
friend	O
,	O
she	O
had	O
kindly	O
extended	O
hospitality	O
to	O
seven	O
of	O
my	O
countrypeople	O
who	O
,	O
alas	O
,	O
are	O
refugees	O
from	O
their	O
native	O
land	O
.	O

We	O
Belgians	O
will	O
always	O
remember	O
her	O
with	O
gratitude	O
.	O

Poirot	B-PER
was	O
an	O
extraordinary	O
looking	O
little	O
man	O
.	O

He	O
was	O
hardly	O
more	O
than	O
five	O
feet	O
,	O
four	O
inches	O
,	O
but	O
carried	O
himself	O
with	O
great	O
dignity	O
.	O

His	O
head	O
was	O
exactly	O
the	O
shape	O
of	O
an	O
egg	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
always	O
perched	O
it	O
a	O
little	O
on	O
one	O
side	O
.	O

His	O
moustache	O
was	O
very	O
stiff	O
and	O
military	O
.	O

The	O
neatness	O
of	O
his	O
attire	O
was	O
almost	O
incredible	O
.	O

I	O
believe	O
a	O
speck	O
of	O
dust	O
would	O
have	O
caused	O
him	O
more	O
pain	O
than	O
a	O
bullet	O
wound	O
.	O

Yet	O
this	O
quaint	O
dandyfied	O
little	O
man	O
who	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
sorry	O
to	O
see	O
,	O
now	O
limped	O
badly	O
,	O
had	O
been	O
in	O
his	O
time	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
most	O
celebrated	O
members	O
of	O
the	O
Belgian	O
police	O
.	O

As	O
a	O
detective	O
,	O
his	O
flair	O
had	O
been	O
extraordinary	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
had	O
achieved	O
triumphs	O
by	O
unravelling	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
most	O
baffling	O
cases	O
of	O
the	O
day	O
.	O

He	O
pointed	O
out	O
to	O
me	O
the	O
little	O
house	O
inhabited	O
by	O
him	O
and	O
his	O
fellow	O
Belgians	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
promised	O
to	O
go	O
and	O
see	O
him	O
at	O
an	O
early	O
date	O
.	O

Then	O
he	O
raised	O
his	O
hat	O
with	O
a	O
flourish	O
to	O
Cynthia	B-PER
,	O
and	O
we	O
drove	O
away	O
.	O

He	O
's	O
a	O
dear	O
little	O
man	O
,	O
said	O
Cynthia	B-PER
.	O

I	O
'd	O
no	O
idea	O
you	O
knew	O
him	O
.	O

You	O
've	O
been	O
entertaining	O
a	O
celebrity	O
unawares	O
,	O
I	O
replied	O
.	O

And	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
the	O
way	O
home	O
,	O
I	O
recited	O
to	O
them	O
the	O
various	O
exploits	O
and	O
triumphs	O
of	O
Hercule	B-PER
Poirot	I-PER
.	O

We	O
arrived	O
back	O
in	O
a	O
very	O
cheerful	O
mood	O
.	O

As	O
we	O
entered	O
the	O
hall	O
,	O
Mrs.	B-PER
Inglethorp	I-PER
came	O
out	O
of	O
her	O
boudoir	O

She	O
looked	O
flushed	O
and	O
upset	O
.	O

Oh	O

it	O
's	O
you	O

she	O
said	O

Is	O
there	O
anything	O

Aunt	B-PER

asked	O
Cynthia	B-PER

Certainly	O

,	O
said	O
Mrs.	B-PER
Inglethorp	I-PER
sharply	O
.	O

What	O
should	O
there	O
be	O
?	O

Then	O
catching	O
sight	O
of	O
Dorcas	B-PER
,	O
the	O
parlourmaid	O
,	O
going	O
into	O
the	O
dining-room	O
,	O
she	O
called	O
to	O
her	O
to	O
bring	O
some	O
stamps	O
into	O
the	O
boudoir	O
.	O

Yes	O
,	O
m	O
'm	O

The	O
old	O
servant	O
hesitated	O

added	O
diffidently	O

You	O

Perhaps	O
you	O

Dorcas	B-PER
...	O
yes	O

I	O

Then	O
I	O
'll	O
go	O
to	O

directly	O
after	O

She	O
went	O
into	O
the	O
boudoir	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
Cynthia	B-PER
stared	O
after	O
her	O
.	O

Goodness	O
gracious	O
!	O

I	O
wonder	O
what	O
's	O
up	O
?	O

she	O
said	O
to	O
Lawrence	B-PER
.	O

He	O
did	O
not	O
seem	O
to	O
have	O
heard	O
her	O
,	O
for	O
without	O
a	O
word	O
he	O
turned	O
on	O
his	O
heel	O
and	O
went	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
house	O
.	O

I	O
suggested	O
a	O
quick	O
game	O
of	O
tennis	O
before	O
supper	O
and	O
,	O
Cynthia	B-PER
agreeing	O
,	O
I	O
ran	O
upstairs	O
to	O
fetch	O
my	O
racquet	O
.	O

Mrs.	B-PER
Cavendish	I-PER
was	O
coming	O
down	O
the	O
stairs	O

It	O
may	O
have	O
been	O
my	O
fancy	O
,	O
but	O
she	O
,	O
too	O
,	O
was	O
looking	O
odd	O
and	O
disturbed	O

Had	O
a	O
good	O
walk	O
with	O
Dr	B-PER
Bauerstein	I-PER
?	O

I	O
asked	O
,	O
trying	O
to	O
appear	O
as	O
indifferent	O
as	O
I	O
could	O

I	O
did	O
n't	O
go	O

she	O
replied	O
abruptly	O
.	O

Where	O
is	O
Mrs.	B-PER
Inglethorp	I-PER
?	O

In	O
the	O
boudoir	O
.	O

Her	O
hand	O
clenched	O
itself	O
on	O
the	O
banisters	O
,	O
then	O
she	O
seemed	O
to	O
nerve	O
herself	O
for	O
some	O
encounter	O
,	O
and	O
went	O
rapidly	O
past	O
me	O
down	O
the	O
stairs	O
across	O
the	O
hall	O
to	O
the	O
boudoir	O

the	O
door	O
of	O

she	O
shut	O

As	O
I	O
ran	O
out	O
to	O
the	O
tennis	O
court	O
a	O
few	O
moments	O
later	O
,	O
I	O
had	O
to	O
pass	O
the	O

and	O
was	O
unable	O
to	O
help	O
overhearing	O
the	O
following	O
scrap	O
of	O
dialogue	O
.	O

Mary	B-PER
Cavendish	I-PER
was	O
saying	O
in	O
the	O
voice	O
of	O
a	O
woman	O
desperately	O
controlling	O
herself	O
:	O
Then	O

To	O
which	O
Mrs.	B-PER

it	O

nothing	O

I	O

you	O
in	O

To	O
which	O
Mary	B-PER

replied	O

with	O
a	O
rising	O
bitterness	O
:	O
Of	O

I	O
might	O

him	O

Cynthia	B-PER
was	O
waiting	O
for	O

greeted	O
me	O
eagerly	O
with	O

I	O

Evelyn	B-PER

wisely	O

Cynthia	B-PER
exhausted	O
every	O

I	O
was	O

he	O
was	O
nowhere	O

something	O

What	O

Mary	B-PER

Mr.	B-PER
Inglethorp	I-PER
was	O
in	O
the	O
drawing-room	O
when	O
I	O
came	O
down	O
to	O
supper	O

His	O
face	O
was	O
impassive	O
as	O
ever	O

and	O
the	O
strange	O
unreality	O
of	O
the	O

struck	O
me	O
afresh	O

Mrs.	B-PER
Inglethorp	I-PER
came	O
down	O

She	O
still	O

there	O
was	O

Inglethorp	B-PER

quiet	O

As	O

Mrs.	B-PER

Dr	B-PER

exclaimed	O
Cynthia	B-PER

What	O
a	O
funny	O
time	O
to	O
come	O

I	O
glanced	O
jealously	O
at	O
Mary	B-PER

,	O
but	O
she	O
seemed	O
quite	O
undisturbed	O
,	O
the	O
delicate	O
pallor	O
of	O

did	O
not	O
vary	O

In	O
a	O

Alfred	B-PER

spectacle	O

Mrs.	B-PER

I	O
must	O
make	O
my	O

the	O

I	O

He	O
laughed	O
rather	O
ruefully	O

as	O
he	O
described	O
how	O
he	O

discovered	O
a	O
very	O
rare	O
species	O
of	O
fern	O
in	O
an	O
inaccessible	O
place	O

and	O
in	O
his	O
efforts	O
to	O
obtain	O
it	O

lost	O
his	O
footing	O

slipped	O
ignominiously	O
into	O
a	O
neighbouring	O
pond	O

The	O
sun	O
soon	O
dried	O
me	O
off	O

I	O

had	O
risen	O

Cynthia	B-PER

John	B-PER
was	O
close	O
by	O
me	O

There	O
were	O
therefore	O
three	O
witnesses	O
who	O
could	O
swear	O
that	O
Mrs.	B-PER
Inglethorp	I-PER
was	O
carrying	O
her	O
coffee	O

as	O
yet	O
untasted	O

in	O

My	O
evening	O
was	O
utterly	O
and	O
entirely	O
spoilt	O
by	O
the	O
presence	O
of	O
Dr	B-PER
Bauerstein	I-PER
.	O

It	O
seemed	O
to	O
me	O
the	O
man	O
would	O
never	O
go	O

He	O
rose	O
at	O
last	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
breathed	O
a	O
sigh	O
of	O
relief	O

I	O
'll	O
walk	O
down	O
to	O
the	O
village	O
with	O
you	O

said	O
Mr.	B-PER
Inglethorp	I-PER

I	O
must	O
see	O
our	O

turned	O

John	B-PER

No	O

I	O
will	O
take	O

To	O
make	O
this	O

my	O
story	O
clear	O

I	O
append	O

The	O

seemed	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
middle	O
of	O
the	O
night	O
when	O
I	O
was	O
awakened	O
by	O
Lawrence	B-PER

He	O
had	O
a	O
candle	O
in	O
his	O
hand	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
agitation	O
of	O
his	O
face	O
told	O
me	O
at	O

that	O
something	O
was	O
seriously	O
wrong	O

the	O

sitting	O
up	O

trying	O
to	O
collect	O
my	O
scattered	O

We	O
are	O
afraid	O
my	O
mother	O
is	O
very	O
ill	O

She	O
seems	O
to	O
be	O
having	O
some	O

of	O
fit	O

Unfortunately	O
she	O

John	B-PER
Cavendish	I-PER
joined	O
us	O
,	O
and	O
one	O
or	O
two	O
of	O
the	O
servants	O
were	O
standing	O
round	O
in	O
a	O
state	O
of	O
awe-stricken	O
excitement	O

Lawrence	B-PER
turned	O
to	O
his	O

What	O
do	O
you	O
think	O
we	O
had	O
better	O
do	O
?	O

Never	O
,	O
I	O
thought	O
,	O
had	O
his	O
indecision	O
of	O
character	O
been	O
more	O
apparent	O

John	B-PER
rattled	O
the	O
handle	O
of	O
Mrs.	B-PER
Inglethorp	I-PER
's	O
door	O
violently	O
,	O
but	O
with	O
no	O

It	O
was	O
obviously	O
locked	O

bolted	O
on	O
the	O
inside	O

The	O
whole	O
household	O
was	O
aroused	O
by	O
now	O

The	O
most	O
alarming	O
sounds	O
were	O
audible	O
from	O
the	O
interior	O
of	O
the	O
room	O

Clearly	O
something	O
must	O

Try	O
going	O
through	O
Mr.	B-PER
Inglethorp	I-PER

room	O

cried	O
Dorcas	B-PER

Oh	O
,	O
the	O
poor	O
mistress	O
!	O

Suddenly	O
I	O
realized	O
that	O
Alfred	B-PER
Inglethorp	I-PER
was	O
not	O
with	O
us	O
...	O
that	O
he	O
alone	O
had	O
given	O
no	O
sign	O
of	O
his	O
presence	O

John	B-PER
opened	O
the	O
door	O
of	O
his	O
room	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
pitch	O
dark	O
,	O
but	O
Lawrence	B-PER
was	O
following	O
with	O
the	O
candle	O
,	O
and	O
by	O
its	O
feeble	O
light	O
we	O
saw	O
that	O
the	O
bed	O
had	O
not	O
been	O
slept	O
in	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
sign	O
of	O
the	O
room	O
having	O
been	O
occupied	O

We	O
went	O
straight	O
to	O
the	O
connecting	O
door	O

That	O
,	O
too	O
,	O
was	O
locked	O
or	O
bolted	O
on	O
the	O

What	O
was	O
to	O
be	O
done	O
?	O

Oh	O

dear	O

cried	O
Dorcas	B-PER
,	O
wringing	O
her	O
hands	O
,	O
what	O
ever	O
shall	O
we	O
do	O
?	O

We	O
must	O
try	O
and	O
break	O
the	O
door	O
in	O
,	O
I	O
suppose	O
.	O

It	O
'll	O
be	O
a	O
tough	O
job	O
,	O
though	O
.	O

Here	O
,	O
let	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
maids	O
go	O
down	O

wake	O
Baily	B-PER

tell	O
him	O
to	O

Dr	B-PER
Wilkins	I-PER
at	O
once	O

Now	O
then	O
,	O
we	O
'll	O
have	O
a	O
try	O
at	O
the	O
door	O

Half	O
a	O
moment	O
,	O
though	O
,	O
is	O
n't	O
there	O
a	O
door	O
into	O
Miss	B-PER
Cynthia	I-PER

rooms	O
?	O

Yes	O
,	O
sir	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
's	O
always	O
bolted	O

It	O
's	O
never	O
been	O
undone	O

Well	O
,	O
we	O
might	O
just	O
see	O
.	O

He	O
ran	O
rapidly	O
down	O
the	O
corridor	O
to	O
Cynthia	B-PER
's	O
room	O
.	O

Mary	B-PER
Cavendish	I-PER
was	O
there	O
,	O
shaking	O
the	O
girl	O

who	O
must	O
have	O
been	O
an	O
unusually	O
sound	O
sleeper	O

and	O
trying	O

her	O

In	O
a	O
moment	O
or	O
two	O
he	O
was	O
back	O

No	O
good	O

That	O
's	O
bolted	O
too	O
.	O

We	O
must	O
break	O
in	O
the	O
door	O

I	O
think	O
this	O
one	O
is	O
a	O
shade	O
less	O
solid	O
than	O
the	O
one	O
in	O
the	O
passage	O
.	O

We	O
strained	O
and	O
heaved	O
together	O
.	O

The	O
framework	O
of	O
the	O
door	O
was	O
solid	O
,	O
and	O
for	O
a	O
long	O
time	O
it	O
resisted	O
our	O
efforts	O
,	O
but	O
at	O
last	O
we	O
felt	O
it	O
give	O
beneath	O
our	O
weight	O
,	O
and	O
finally	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
resounding	O
crash	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
burst	O
open	O
.	O

We	O
stumbled	O
in	O
together	O
,	O
Lawrence	B-PER
still	O
holding	O
his	O
candle	O
.	O

Mrs.	B-PER
Inglethorp	I-PER
was	O
lying	O
on	O
the	O
bed	O
,	O
her	O
whole	O
form	O
agitated	O
by	O
violent	O
convulsions	O
,	O
in	O
one	O
of	O
which	O
she	O
must	O
have	O
overturned	O
the	O
table	O
beside	O
her	O
.	O

As	O
we	O
entered	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
her	O
limbs	O
relaxed	O
,	O
and	O
she	O
fell	O
back	O
upon	O
the	O
pillows	O
.	O

John	B-PER
strode	O
across	O
the	O
room	O
,	O
and	O
lit	O
the	O
gas	O
.	O

Turning	O
to	O
Annie	B-PER
,	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
housemaids	O
,	O
he	O
sent	O
her	O
downstairs	O
to	O
the	O
dining-room	O
for	O
brandy	O
.	O

Then	O
he	O
went	O
across	O
to	O
his	O
mother	O
whilst	O
I	O
unbolted	O
the	O
door	O
that	O
gave	O
on	O
the	O
corridor	O
.	O

I	O
turned	O
to	O
Lawrence	B-PER
,	O
to	O
suggest	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
better	O
leave	O
them	O
now	O
that	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
further	O
need	O
of	O
my	O
services	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
words	O
were	O
frozen	O
on	O
my	O
lips	O
.	O

Never	O
have	O
I	O
seen	O
such	O
a	O
ghastly	O
look	O
on	O
any	O
man	O
's	O
face	O
.	O

He	O
was	O
white	O
as	O
chalk	O
,	O
the	O
candle	O
he	O
held	O
in	O
his	O
shaking	O
hand	O
was	O
sputtering	O
onto	O
the	O
carpet	O
,	O
and	O
his	O
eyes	O
,	O
petrified	O
with	O
terror	O
,	O
or	O
some	O
such	O
kindred	O
emotion	O
,	O
stared	O
fixedly	O
over	O
my	O
head	O
at	O
a	O
point	O
on	O
the	O
further	O
wall	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
as	O
though	O
he	O
had	O
seen	O
something	O
that	O
turned	O
him	O
to	O
stone	O
.	O

I	O
instinctively	O
followed	O
the	O
direction	O
of	O
his	O
eyes	O
,	O
but	O
I	O
could	O
see	O
nothing	O
unusual	O
.	O

The	O
still	O
feebly	O
flickering	O
ashes	O
in	O
the	O
grate	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
row	O
of	O
prim	O
ornaments	O
on	O
the	O
mantelpiece	O
,	O
were	O
surely	O
harmless	O
enough	O
.	O

The	O
violence	O
of	O
Mrs.	B-PER
Inglethorp	I-PER
's	O
attack	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
passing	O
.	O

She	O
was	O
able	O
to	O
speak	O
in	O
short	O
gasps	O
.	O

Better	O
now	O
...	O
very	O
sudden	O
...	O
stupid	O
of	O
me	O
...	O
to	O
lock	O
myself	O
in	O
.	O

A	O
shadow	O
fell	O
on	O
the	O
bed	O
and	O
,	O
looking	O
up	O
,	O
I	O
saw	O
Mary	B-PER
Cavendish	I-PER
standing	O
near	O
the	O
door	O
with	O
her	O
arm	O
around	O
Cynthia	B-PER
.	O

She	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
supporting	O
the	O
girl	O
,	O
who	O
looked	O
utterly	O
dazed	O
and	O
unlike	O
herself	O
.	O

Her	O
face	O
was	O
heavily	O
flushed	O
,	O
and	O
she	O
yawned	O
repeatedly	O
.	O

Poor	O
Cynthia	B-PER
is	O
quite	O
frightened	O
,	O
said	O
Mrs.	B-PER
Cavendish	I-PER
in	O
a	O
low	O
clear	O
voice	O
.	O

She	O
herself	O
,	O
I	O
noticed	O
,	O
was	O
dressed	O
in	O
her	O
white	O
land	O
smock	O
.	O

Then	O
it	O
must	O
be	O
later	O
than	O
I	O
thought	O
.	O

I	O
saw	O
that	O
a	O
faint	O
streak	O
of	O
daylight	O
was	O
showing	O
through	O
the	O
curtains	O
of	O
the	O
windows	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
the	O
clock	O
on	O
the	O
mantelpiece	O
pointed	O
to	O
close	O
upon	O
five	O
o'clock	O
.	O

A	O
strangled	O
cry	O
from	O
the	O
bed	O
startled	O
me	O
.	O

A	O
fresh	O
access	O
of	O
pain	O
seized	O
the	O
unfortunate	O
old	O
lady	O
.	O

The	O
convulsions	O
were	O
of	O
a	O
violence	O
terrible	O
to	O
behold	O
.	O

Everything	O
was	O
confusion	O
.	O

We	O
thronged	O
round	O
her	O
,	O
powerless	O
to	O
help	O
or	O
alleviate	O
.	O

A	O
final	O
convulsion	O
lifted	O
her	O
from	O
the	O
bed	O
,	O
until	O
she	O
appeared	O
to	O
rest	O
upon	O
her	O
head	O
and	O
her	O
heels	O
,	O
with	O
her	O
body	O
arched	O
in	O
an	O
extraordinary	O
manner	O
.	O

In	O
vain	O
Mary	B-PER
and	O
John	B-PER
tried	O
to	O
administer	O
more	O
brandy	O
.	O

The	O
moments	O
flew	O
.	O

Again	O
the	O
body	O
arched	O
itself	O
in	O
that	O
peculiar	O
fashion	O
.	O

At	O
that	O
moment	O
,	O
Dr	B-PER
Bauerstein	I-PER
pushed	O
his	O
way	O
authoritatively	O
into	O
the	O
room	O
.	O

For	O
one	O
instant	O
he	O
stopped	O
dead	O
,	O
staring	O
at	O
the	O
figure	O
on	O
the	O
bed	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
instant	O
,	O
Mrs.	B-PER
Inglethorp	I-PER
cried	O
out	O
in	O
a	O
strangled	O
voice	O
,	O
her	O
eyes	O
fixed	O
on	O
the	O
doctor	O
:	O
Alfred	B-PER
...	O
Alfred	B-PER
...	O
.	O

Then	O
she	O
fell	O
back	O
motionless	O
on	O
the	O
pillows	O
.	O

With	O
a	O
stride	O
,	O
the	O
doctor	O
reached	O
the	O
bed	O
,	O
and	O
seizing	O
her	O
arms	O
worked	O
them	O
energetically	O
,	O
applying	O
what	O
I	O
knew	O
to	O
be	O
artificial	O
respiration	O
.	O

He	O
issued	O
a	O
few	O
short	O
sharp	O
orders	O
to	O
the	O
servants	O
.	O

An	O
imperious	O
wave	O
of	O
his	O
hand	O
drove	O
us	O
all	O
to	O
the	O
door	O
.	O

We	O
watched	O
him	O
,	O
fascinated	O
,	O
though	O
I	O
think	O
we	O
all	O
knew	O
in	O
our	O
hearts	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
too	O
late	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
nothing	O
could	O
be	O
done	O
now	O
.	O

I	O
could	O
see	O
by	O
the	O
expression	O
on	O
his	O
face	O
that	O
he	O
himself	O
had	O
little	O
hope	O
.	O

Finally	O
he	O
abandoned	O
his	O
task	O
,	O
shaking	O
his	O
head	O
gravely	O
.	O

At	O
that	O
moment	O
,	O
we	O
heard	O
footsteps	O
outside	O
,	O
and	O
Dr	B-PER
Wilkins	I-PER
,	O
Mrs.	B-PER
Inglethorp	I-PER
's	O

,	O
a	O
portly	O

fussy	O
little	O
man	O
,	O
came	O
bustling	O
in	O
.	O

In	O
a	O
few	O
words	O
DrBauerstein	B-PER
explained	O
how	O
he	O
had	O
happened	O
to	O
be	O
passing	O
the	O
lodge	O
gates	O
as	O
the	O
car	O
came	O
out	O

had	O
run	O
up	O
to	O
the	O

as	O

as	O
he	O
could	O
,	O
whilst	O
the	O

went	O
on	O

Dr	B-PER
Wilkins	I-PER

With	O
a	O
faint	O
gesture	O
of	O
the	O
hand	O

he	O
indicated	O
the	O
figure	O
on	O
the	O

Very	O
sad	O

Very	O

Dr	B-PER

Dr	B-PER
Bauerstein	I-PER
,	O
I	O
noticed	O
,	O
was	O
watching	O
the	O
local	O
doctor	O
narrowly	O
.	O

He	O
still	O
kept	O
his	O
eyes	O
fixed	O
on	O
him	O
as	O
he	O
spoke	O

The	O
convulsions	O
were	O
of	O
a	O
peculiar	O
violence	O

Dr	B-PER

I	O
am	O
sorry	O
you	O
were	O
not	O
here	O
in	O
time	O
to	O
witness	O
them	O

They	O
were	O
quite	O
...	O
tetanic	O
in	O
character	O

Ah	O
!	O

said	O
Dr	B-PER
Wilkins	I-PER
wisely	O

I	O
should	O
like	O
to	O
speak	O
to	O
you	O
in	O
private	O

said	O
Dr	B-PER
Bauerstein	I-PER

He	O
turned	O
to	O
John	B-PER
.	O

You	O
do	O
not	O
object	O
?	O

Certainly	O
not	O
.	O

We	O
all	O
trooped	O
out	O
into	O
the	O
corridor	O
,	O
leaving	O
the	O
two	O
doctors	O
alone	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
heard	O
the	O
key	O
turned	O
in	O
the	O
lock	O
behind	O
us	O
.	O

We	O
went	O
slowly	O
down	O
the	O
stairs	O

I	O
was	O
violently	O
excited	O
.	O

I	O
have	O
a	O
certain	O
talent	O
for	O
deduction	O
,	O
and	O
Dr	B-PER
Bauerstein	I-PER
's	O
manner	O
had	O
started	O
a	O
flock	O
of	O
wild	O
surmises	O
in	O
my	O
mind	O

Mary	B-PER
Cavendish	I-PER
laid	O
her	O
hand	O
upon	O
my	O
arm	O

What	O
is	O
it	O
?	O

Why	O
did	O
Dr	B-PER
Bauerstein	I-PER
seem	O
so	O
...	O
peculiar	O
?	O

I	O
looked	O
at	O
her	O

Do	O
you	O
know	O
what	O
I	O
think	O

What	O
?	O

Listen	O

I	O
looked	O
round	O
,	O
the	O
others	O
were	O
out	O
of	O
earshot	O
.	O

I	O
lowered	O
my	O
voice	O
to	O
a	O
whisper	O
.	O

I	O
believe	O
she	O
has	O
been	O
poisoned	O
!	O

I	O
'm	O
certain	O
Dr	B-PER
Bauerstein	I-PER
suspects	O
it	O

What	O
?	O

She	O
shrank	O
against	O
the	O
wall	O
,	O
the	O
pupils	O
of	O
her	O
eyes	O
dilating	O
wildly	O
.	O

Then	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
sudden	O
cry	O
that	O
startled	O
me	O
,	O
she	O
cried	O
out	O
:	O
No	O
,	O
no	O
...	O
not	O
that	O
...	O
not	O
that	O
!	O

And	O
breaking	O
from	O
me	O
,	O
fled	O
up	O
the	O
stairs	O
.	O

I	O
followed	O
her	O
,	O
afraid	O
that	O
she	O
was	O
going	O
to	O
faint	O
.	O

I	O
found	O
her	O
leaning	O
against	O
the	O
bannisters	O
,	O
deadly	O
pale	O
.	O

She	O
waved	O
me	O
away	O
impatiently	O
.	O

No	O
,	O
no	O
...	O
leave	O
me	O
.	O

I	O
'd	O
rather	O
be	O
alone	O
.	O

Let	O
me	O
just	O
be	O
quiet	O
for	O
a	O
minute	O
or	O
two	O
.	O

Go	O
down	O
to	O
the	O
others	O
.	O

I	O
obeyed	O
her	O
reluctantly	O
.	O

John	B-PER
and	O
Lawrence	B-PER
were	O
in	O
the	O
dining-room	O
.	O

I	O
joined	O
them	O
.	O

We	O
were	O
all	O
silent	O
,	O
but	O
I	O
suppose	O
I	O
voiced	O
the	O
thoughts	O
of	O
us	O
all	O
when	O
I	O
at	O
last	O
broke	O
it	O
by	O
saying	O
:	O
Where	O
is	O
Mr.	B-PER
Inglethorp	I-PER
?	O

John	B-PER
shook	O
his	O
head	O
.	O

He	O
's	O
not	O
in	O
the	O
house	O
.	O

Our	O
eyes	O
met	O
.	O

Where	O
was	O
Alfred	B-PER
Inglethorp	I-PER
?	O

His	O
absence	O
was	O
strange	O
and	O
inexplicable	O
.	O

I	O
remembered	O
Mrs.	B-PER
Inglethorp	I-PER
's	O
dying	O
words	O
.	O

What	O
lay	O
beneath	O
them	O
?	O

What	O
more	O
could	O
she	O
have	O
told	O
us	O
,	O
if	O
she	O
had	O
had	O
time	O
?	O

At	O
last	O
we	O
heard	O
the	O
doctors	O
descending	O
the	O
stairs	O
.	O

Dr	B-PER
Wilkins	I-PER
was	O
looking	O
important	O
and	O
excited	O
,	O
and	O
trying	O
to	O
conceal	O
an	O
inward	O
exultation	O
under	O
a	O
manner	O
of	O
decorous	O
calm	O
.	O

Dr	B-PER
Bauerstein	I-PER
remained	O
in	O
the	O
background	O
,	O
his	O
grave	O
bearded	O
face	O
unchanged	O
.	O

Dr	B-PER
Wilkins	I-PER
was	O
the	O
spokesman	O
for	O
the	O
two	O
.	O

He	O
addressed	O
himself	O
to	O
John	B-PER
:	O
Mr.	B-PER
Cavendish	I-PER
,	O
I	O
should	O
like	O
your	O
consent	O
to	O
a	O
postmortem	O
.	O

Is	O
that	O
necessary	O
?	O

asked	O
John	B-PER
gravely	O
.	O

A	O
spasm	O
of	O
pain	O
crossed	O
his	O
face	O
.	O

Absolutely	O
,	O
said	O
Dr	B-PER
Bauerstein	I-PER
.	O

You	O
mean	O
by	O
that	O
...	O
?	O

That	O
neither	O
Dr	B-PER
Wilkins	I-PER
nor	O
myself	O
could	O
give	O
a	O
death	O
certificate	O
under	O
the	O
circumstances	O
.	O

John	B-PER
bent	O
his	O
head	O
.	O

In	O
that	O
case	O
,	O
I	O
have	O
no	O
alternative	O
but	O
to	O
agree	O
.	O

Thank	O
you	O
,	O
said	O
Dr	B-PER
Wilkins	I-PER
briskly	O
.	O

We	O
propose	O
that	O
it	O
should	O
take	O
place	O
tomorrow	O
night	O
...	O
or	O
rather	O
tonight	O
.	O

And	O
he	O
glanced	O
at	O
the	O
daylight	O
.	O

Under	O
the	O
circumstances	O
,	O
I	O
am	O
afraid	O
an	O
inquest	O
can	O
hardly	O
be	O
avoided	O
...	O
these	O
formalities	O
are	O
necessary	O
,	O
but	O
I	O
beg	O
that	O
you	O
wo	O
n't	O
distress	O
yourselves	O
.	O

There	O
was	O
a	O
pause	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
Dr	B-PER
Bauerstein	I-PER
drew	O
two	O
keys	O
from	O
his	O
pocket	O
,	O
and	O
handed	O
them	O
to	O
John	B-PER
.	O

These	O
are	O
the	O
keys	O
of	O
the	O
two	O
rooms	O
.	O

I	O
have	O
locked	O
them	O
and	O
,	O
in	O
my	O
opinion	O
,	O
they	O
would	O
be	O
better	O
kept	O
locked	O
for	O
the	O
present	O
.	O

The	O
doctors	O
then	O
departed	O
.	O

I	O
had	O
been	O
turning	O
over	O
an	O
idea	O
in	O
my	O
head	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
felt	O
that	O
the	O
moment	O
had	O
now	O
come	O
to	O
broach	O
it	O
.	O

Yet	O
I	O
was	O
a	O
little	O
chary	O
of	O
doing	O
so	O
.	O

John	B-PER
,	O
I	O
knew	O
,	O
had	O
a	O
horror	O
of	O
any	O
kind	O
of	O
publicity	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
an	O
easygoing	O
optimist	O
,	O
who	O
preferred	O
never	O
to	O
meet	O
trouble	O
half-way	O
.	O

It	O
might	O
be	O
difficult	O
to	O
convince	O
him	O
of	O
the	O
soundness	O
of	O
my	O
plan	O
.	O

Lawrence	B-PER
,	O
on	O
the	O
other	O
hand	O
,	O
being	O
less	O
conventional	O
,	O
and	O
having	O
more	O
imagination	O
,	O
I	O
felt	O
I	O
might	O
count	O
upon	O
as	O
an	O
ally	O
.	O

There	O
was	O
no	O
doubt	O
that	O
the	O
moment	O
had	O
come	O
for	O
me	O
to	O
take	O
the	O
lead	O
.	O

John	B-PER
,	O
I	O
said	O
,	O
I	O
am	O
going	O
to	O
ask	O
you	O
something	O

Well	O

You	O
remember	O
my	O

The	O
Belgian	O

He	O

Rubbish	O
!	O

cried	O
Lawrence	B-PER
angrily	O
.	O

In	O
my	O
opinion	O
the	O
whole	O
thing	O
is	O
a	O
mare	O
's	O
nest	O
of	O
Bauerstein	B-PER
's	O
!	O

Wilkins	B-PER
had	O
n't	O
an	O
idea	O
of	O
such	O
a	O
thing	O
,	O
until	O
Bauerstein	B-PER
put	O
it	O
into	O
his	O
head	O
.	O

But	O
,	O
like	O
all	O
specialists	O
,	O
Bauerstein	B-PER
's	O
got	O
a	O
bee	O
in	O
his	O
bonnet	O
.	O

Poisons	O
are	O
his	O
hobby	O
,	O
so	O
of	O
course	O
he	O
sees	O
them	O
everywhere	O
.	O

I	O
confess	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
surprised	O
by	O
Lawrence	B-PER
's	O
attitude	O
.	O

He	O
was	O
so	O
seldom	O
vehement	O
about	O
anything	O
.	O

John	B-PER
hesitated	O
.	O

I	O
ca	O
n't	O
feel	O
as	O
you	O
do	O
,	O
Lawrence	B-PER
,	O
he	O
said	O
at	O
last	O
.	O

I	O
'm	O
inclined	O
to	O
give	O
Hastings	B-PER
a	O
free	O
hand	O
,	O
though	O
I	O
should	O
prefer	O
to	O
wait	O
a	O
bit	O

We	O
do	O
n't	O
want	O
any	O
unnecessary	O
scandal	O

No	O
,	O
no	O
,	O
I	O
cried	O
eagerly	O
,	O
you	O
need	O
have	O
no	O
fear	O
of	O
that	O
.	O

Poirot	B-PER
is	O
discretion	O
itself	O

Very	O
well	O
,	O
then	O
,	O
have	O
it	O
your	O
own	O
way	O
.	O

I	O
leave	O
it	O
in	O
your	O
hands	O
.	O

Though	O
,	O
if	O
it	O
is	O
as	O
we	O
suspect	O
,	O
it	O
seems	O
a	O
clear	O
enough	O
case	O
.	O

God	O
forgive	O
me	O
if	O
I	O
am	O
wronging	O
him	O
!	O

I	O
looked	O
at	O
my	O
watch	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
six	O
o'clock	O
.	O

I	O
determined	O
to	O
lose	O
no	O
time	O
.	O

Five	O
minutes	O
'	O
delay	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
I	O
allowed	O
myself	O
.	O

I	O
spent	O
it	O
in	O
ransacking	O
the	O
library	O
until	O
I	O
discovered	O
a	O
medical	O
book	O
which	O
gave	O
a	O
description	O
of	O
strychnine	O
poisoning	O
.	O

The	O
house	O
which	O
the	O
Belgians	O
occupied	O
in	O
the	O
village	O
was	O
quite	O
close	O
to	O
the	O
park	O
gates	O
.	O

One	O
could	O
save	O
time	O
by	O
taking	O
a	O
narrow	O
path	O
through	O
the	O
long	O
grass	O
,	O
which	O
cut	O
off	O
the	O
detours	O
of	O
the	O
winding	O
drive	O
.	O

So	O
I	O
,	O
accordingly	O
,	O
went	O
that	O
way	O
.	O

I	O
had	O
nearly	O
reached	O
the	O
lodge	O
,	O
when	O
my	O
attention	O
was	O
arrested	O
by	O
the	O
running	O
figure	O
of	O
a	O
man	O
approaching	O
me	O

It	O
was	O
Mr.	B-PER
Inglethorp	I-PER

Where	O
had	O
he	O
been	O
?	O

How	O
did	O
he	O
intend	O
to	O
explain	O
his	O
absence	O
?	O

He	O
accosted	O
me	O
eagerly	O

My	O
God	O

This	O
is	O
terrible	O

My	O
poor	O

I	O
have	O
only	O
just	O
heard	O

Where	O
have	O
you	O

I	O
asked	O
.	O

Denby	B-PER
kept	O
me	O
late	O
last	O
night	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
one	O
o'clock	O
before	O
we	O
'd	O
finished	O

Then	O
I	O
found	O
that	O
I	O
'd	O
forgotten	O
the	O
latch-key	O
after	O
all	O

I	O
did	O
n't	O
want	O
to	O
arouse	O
the	O

so	O
Denby	B-PER
gave	O
me	O
a	O
bed	O

How	O
did	O
you	O
hear	O
the	O
news	O
?	O

I	O
asked	O
.	O

Wilkins	B-PER
knocked	O
Denby	B-PER
up	O
to	O
tell	O
him	O

My	O
poor	O
Emily	B-PER
!	O

She	O
was	O
so	O
self-sacrificing	O
...	O
such	O
a	O
noble	O
character	O
.	O

She	O
over-taxed	O
her	O
strength	O
.	O

A	O
wave	O
of	O
revulsion	O
swept	O
over	O
me	O
.	O

What	O
a	O
consummate	O
hypocrite	O
the	O
man	O
was	O
!	O

I	O
must	O
hurry	O
on	O
,	O
I	O
said	O
,	O
thankful	O
that	O
he	O
did	O
not	O
ask	O
me	O
whither	O
I	O
was	O
bound	O

In	O
a	O
few	O
minutes	O
I	O
was	O
knocking	O
at	O
the	O
door	O
of	O
Leastways	O
Cottage	O
.	O

Getting	O
no	O
answer	O
,	O
I	O
repeated	O
my	O
summons	O
impatiently	O

A	O
window	O
above	O
me	O
was	O
cautiously	O
opened	O
,	O
and	O
Poirot	B-PER
himself	O
looked	O
out	O

He	O
gave	O
an	O
exclamation	O
of	O
surprise	O
at	O
seeing	O
me	O
.	O

In	O
a	O
few	O
brief	O
words	O
,	O
I	O
explained	O
the	O
tragedy	O
that	O
had	O
occurred	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
I	O
wanted	O
his	O
help	O
.	O

Wait	O

I	O
will	O

you	O

recount	O
to	O
me	O
the	O
affair	O
whilst	O
I	O
dress	O

In	O
a	O
few	O
moments	O
he	O
had	O
unbarred	O
the	O
door	O

and	O
I	O
followed	O
him	O
up	O
to	O
his	O
room	O

There	O
he	O
installed	O
me	O
in	O
a	O
chair	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
related	O
the	O
whole	O
story	O

keeping	O
back	O
nothing	O

and	O
omitting	O
no	O

whilst	O
he	O
himself	O
made	O
a	O

The	O
present	O
contention	O
is	O
that	O
Mrs.	B-PER

strychnine	O

presumably	O
administered	O
in	O
her	O

,	O
what	O
time	O
was	O
the	O
coffee	O
served	O
?	O

About	O
eight	O
o'clock	O

Therefore	O
she	O
drank	O
it	O
between	O
then	O
and	O
half-past	O
eight	O
...	O
certainly	O
not	O
much	O
later	O
.	O

Well	O
,	O
strychnine	O
is	O
a	O
fairly	O
rapid	O
poison	O
.	O

Its	O
effects	O
would	O
be	O
felt	O
very	O
soon	O
,	O
probably	O
in	O
about	O
an	O
hour	O
.	O

Yet	O
,	O
in	O
Mrs.	B-PER
Inglethorp	I-PER
's	O
case	O
,	O
the	O
symptoms	O
do	O
not	O
manifest	O
themselves	O
until	O
five	O
o'clock	O
the	O
next	O
morning	O
:	O
nine	O
hours	O
!	O

But	O
a	O
heavy	O
meal	O
,	O
taken	O
at	O
about	O
the	O

time	O
as	O
the	O
poison	O
,	O
might	O
retard	O
its	O
effects	O
,	O
though	O
hardly	O
to	O
that	O
extent	O
.	O

Still	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
a	O
possibility	O
to	O
be	O
taken	O
into	O
account	O
.	O

But	O
,	O
according	O
to	O
you	O
,	O
she	O
ate	O
very	O
little	O
for	O
supper	O
,	O
and	O
yet	O
the	O
symptoms	O
do	O
not	O
develop	O
until	O
early	O
the	O
next	O

!	O

Now	O
that	O
is	O
a	O
curious	O
circumstance	O

my	O

Something	O
may	O
arise	O
at	O

my	O

one	O
may	O
live	O
in	O
a	O
big	O
house	O
and	O
yet	O
have	O
no	O
comfort	O

After	O
which	O
piece	O
of	O
moralizing	O
,	O
he	O
resumed	O
his	O
search	O

A	O
small	O
purple	O
despatch-case	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
key	O
in	O
the	O
lock	O
,	O
on	O
the	O
writing-table	O
,	O
engaged	O
his	O
attention	O
for	O
some	O
time	O
.	O

He	O
took	O
out	O
the	O
key	O
from	O
the	O
lock	O
,	O
and	O
passed	O
it	O
to	O
me	O
to	O
inspect	O
.	O

I	O
saw	O
nothing	O
peculiar	O
,	O
however	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
an	O
ordinary	O
key	O
of	O
the	O
Yale	B-ORG
type	O
,	O
with	O
a	O
bit	O
of	O
twisted	O
wire	O
through	O
the	O
handle	O
.	O

Next	O
,	O
he	O
examined	O
the	O
framework	O
of	O
the	O
door	O
we	O
had	O
broken	O
in	O
,	O
assuring	O
himself	O
that	O
the	O
bolt	O
had	O
really	O
been	O
shot	O
.	O

Then	O
he	O
went	O
to	O
the	O
door	O
opposite	O
leading	O
into	O
Cynthia	B-PER
's	O
room	O
.	O

That	O
door	O
was	O
also	O
bolted	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
had	O
stated	O

``	O
However	O
,	O
he	O
went	O
to	O
the	O
length	O
of	O
unbolting	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
opening	O
and	O
shutting	O
it	O
several	O
times	O
;	O
this	O
he	O
did	O
with	O
the	O
utmost	O
precaution	O
against	O
making	O
any	O
noise	O
.	O
''	O

Suddenly	O
something	O
in	O
the	O
bolt	O
itself	O
seemed	O
to	O
rivet	O
his	O
attention	O
.	O

He	O
examined	O
it	O
carefully	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
,	O
nimbly	O
whipping	O
out	O
a	O
pair	O
of	O
small	O
forceps	O
from	O
his	O
case	O
,	O
he	O
drew	O
out	O
some	O
minute	O
particle	O

he	O
carefully	O
sealed	O
up	O
in	O
a	O
tiny	O
envelope	O

On	O
the	O
chest	O
of	O

there	O
was	O
a	O

A	O
small	O
quantity	O
of	O
a	O

remained	O
in	O
the	O

and	O
an	O
empty	O
cup	O

that	O
had	O
been	O

out	O

I	O
wondered	O
how	O
I	O
could	O
have	O
been	O
so	O
unobservant	O

to	O

this	O

Here	O
was	O

Poirot	B-PER
delicately	O
dipped	O
his	O
finger	O
into	O

I	O
must	O

I	O

her	O

we	O
do	O
hope	O

there	O

to	O
bring	O

and	O
then	O
,	O
resuming	O
his	O

the	O

I	O
heard	O
what	O

He	O
spoke	O
a	O

she	O
answered	O

you	O

I	O

you	O

Again	O
I	O
did	O

`	O
Nothing	O

when	O
I	O

the	O

I	O
saw	O
it	O
at	O

I	O
suppose	O
I	O
ought	O

taken	O

down	O

asked	O
Cook	B-PER

I	O

I	O

one	O
of	O
the	O
most	O

I	O
marvelled	O
at	O
Poirot	B-PER

What	O
is	O
a	O
great	O
discovery	O
?	O

Why	O
,	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
cocoa	O
and	O
not	O
the	O
coffee	O
that	O
was	O
poisoned	O

That	O

Of	O

It	O
is	O
a	O
very	O
difficult	O
situation	O
for	O
you	O

Mr.	B-PER

I	O
would	O
like	O
to	O
ask	O
you	O
one	O
question	O

Mr.	B-PER
Inglethorp	I-PER
's	O
reason	O
for	O
not	O
returning	O
last	O

I	O

that	O

the	O

Is	O
not	O
that	O
so	O
?	O

Yes	O

I	O
suppose	O
you	O
are	O
quite	O
sure	O
that	O
the	O

was	O

that	O
he	O
did	O
not	O
take	O
it	O
after	O
all	O

I	O
have	O
no	O
idea	O

I	O
never	O
thought	O
of	O
looking	O

We	O
always	O
keep	O
it	O
in	O

I	O
'll	O
go	O

Poirot	B-PER
held	O
up	O
his	O

with	O
a	O
faint	O
smile	O

No	O
,	O
no	O
,	O
Mr.	B-PER
Cavendish	I-PER
,	O
it	O
is	O
too	O
late	O
now	O
.	O

I	O
am	O
certain	O
that	O
you	O
would	O
find	O
it	O
.	O

If	O
Mr.	B-PER
Inglethorp	I-PER
did	O
take	O
it	O
,	O
he	O
has	O
had	O
ample	O

it	O
by	O
now	O

But	O
do	O
you	O

I	O

nothing	O

If	O

this	O

before	O
his	O

it	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
a	O

That	O
is	O
all	O

John	B-PER
looked	O
perplexed	O

Do	O
not	O

,	O
said	O
Poirot	B-PER
smoothly	O
.	O

I	O
assure	O
you	O
that	O
you	O
need	O
not	O
let	O
it	O
trouble	O
you	O

Since	O
you	O
are	O
so	O
kind	O
,	O
let	O
us	O
go	O
and	O
have	O
some	O
breakfast	O

Every	O

was	O
assembled	O
in	O
the	O
dining-room	O

dining-room	O
.	O

Under	O
the	O
circumstances	O
,	O
we	O
were	O
naturally	O
not	O
a	O
cheerful	O
party	O
.	O

The	O
reaction	O
after	O
a	O
shock	O
is	O
always	O
trying	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
think	O
we	O
were	O
all	O
suffering	O
from	O
it	O
.	O

Decorum	O
and	O
good	O
breeding	O
naturally	O
enjoined	O
that	O
our	O
demeanour	O
should	O
be	O
much	O
as	O
usual	O
,	O
yet	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
help	O
wondering	O
if	O
this	O
self-control	O
were	O
really	O
a	O
matter	O
of	O
great	O
difficulty	O
.	O

There	O
were	O
no	O
red	O
eyes	O
,	O
no	O
signs	O
of	O
secretly	O
indulged	O
grief	O
.	O

I	O
felt	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
right	O
in	O
my	O
opinion	O
that	O
Dorcas	B-PER
was	O
the	O
person	O
most	O
affected	O
by	O
the	O
personal	O
side	O
of	O
the	O
tragedy	O
.	O

I	O
pass	O
over	O
Alfred	B-PER
Inglethorp	I-PER
,	O
who	O
acted	O
the	O
bereaved	O
widower	O
in	O
a	O
manner	O
that	O
I	O
felt	O
to	O
be	O
disgusting	O
in	O
its	O
hypocrisy	O
.	O

Did	O
he	O
know	O
that	O
we	O
suspected	O
him	O
,	O
I	O
wondered	O
.	O

Surely	O
he	O
could	O
not	O
be	O
unaware	O
of	O
the	O
fact	O
,	O
conceal	O
it	O
as	O
we	O
would	O
.	O

Did	O
he	O
feel	O
some	O
secret	O
stirring	O
of	O
fear	O
,	O
or	O
was	O
he	O
confident	O
that	O
his	O
crime	O
would	O
go	O
unpunished	O
?	O

Surely	O
the	O
suspicion	O
in	O
the	O
atmosphere	O
must	O
warn	O
him	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
already	O
a	O
marked	O
man	O
.	O

But	O
did	O
every	O
one	O
suspect	O
him	O
?	O

What	O
about	O
Mrs.	B-PER
Cavendish	I-PER
?	O

I	O
watched	O
her	O
as	O
she	O
sat	O
at	O
the	O
head	O
of	O
the	O
table	O

graceful	O

In	O

with	O
white	O
ruffles	O
at	O
the	O

falling	O
over	O
her	O
slender	O

she	O
looked	O
very	O
beautiful	O

When	O
she	O
chose	O

however	O
,	O
her	O
face	O
could	O
be	O
sphinx-like	O
in	O
its	O
inscrutability	O

She	O
was	O
very	O
silent	O
,	O
hardly	O
opening	O
her	O
lips	O
,	O
and	O
yet	O
in	O
some	O
queer	O
way	O
I	O
felt	O
that	O
the	O
great	O
strength	O
of	O
her	O
personality	O
was	O
dominating	O
us	O
all	O
.	O

And	O
little	O
Cynthia	B-PER
?	O

Did	O
she	O
suspect	O
?	O

She	O
looked	O
very	O
tired	O
and	O
ill	O
,	O
I	O
thought	O
.	O

The	O
heaviness	O
and	O
languor	O
of	O
her	O
manner	O
were	O
very	O
marked	O

I	O
asked	O
her	O
if	O
she	O
were	O
feeling	O
ill	O

and	O
she	O
answered	O
frankly	O
:	O
Yes	O

I	O

Poirot	B-PER
to	O
himself	O
,	O
as	O
he	O
brought	O
back	O
the	O

Only	O
I	O
heard	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
glancing	O
up	O
curiously	O
at	O
the	O
little	O
man	O
I	O
saw	O
that	O
his	O

was	O
working	O
with	O
suppressed	O
excitement	O
,	O
and	O
his	O
eyes	O
were	O
as	O
green	O
as	O
a	O

He	O
had	O
heard	O

seen	O
something	O
that	O
had	O
affected	O
him	O
strongly	O

but	O
what	O
was	O
it	O
?	O

I	O
do	O
not	O
usually	O
label	O
myself	O
as	O
dense	O

but	O
I	O
must	O
confess	O
that	O
nothing	O
out	O
of	O
the	O

had	O
attracted	O
my	O
attention	O

In	O
another	O

the	O

Dorcas	B-PER

Mr.	B-PER

I	O
remembered	O
the	O

whom	O
Mrs.	B-PER

Then	O
he	O
turned	O
to	O

My	O

Perhaps	O

We	O
acquiesced	O

followed	O
him	O
out	O

John	B-PER

on	O

I	O
took	O
the	O

into	O

and	O
he	O
closed	O
the	O
door	O
behind	O

Mr.	B-PER

a	O
pleasant	O

with	O

the	O

John	B-PER
introduced	O

You	O
will	O

Wells	B-PER

added	O

that	O
this	O
is	O
all	O

We	O

Mr.	B-PER

soothingly	O

I	O

you	O

of	O

John	B-PER
with	O
a	O
certain	O

over	O
John	B-PER

It	O
puzzled	O

Poirot	B-PER

I	O

Taking	O

Poirot	B-PER

These	O

Poirot	B-PER

Who	O

That	O

Ah	O

if	O

knew	O

When	O
?	O

Since	O
I	O
was	O
here	O
an	O
hour	O

As	O
to	O
the	O
door	O

locked	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
a	O
very	O
ordinary	O
lock	O

Probably	O
any	O
other	O
of	O
the	O

in	O
this	O
passage	O
would	O
fit	O
it	O

We	O
stared	O
at	O
one	O
another	O
blankly	O
.	O

Poirot	B-PER
had	O
walked	O
over	O
to	O
the	O
mantel-piece	O
.	O

He	O
was	O
outwardly	O
calm	O
,	O
but	O
I	O
noticed	O
his	O
hands	O
,	O
which	O
from	O
long	O
force	O
of	O
habit	O
were	O
mechanically	O
straightening	O
the	O
spill	O
vases	O
on	O
the	O
mantel-piece	O
,	O
were	O
shaking	O
violently	O

See	O
here	O
,	O
it	O
was	O
like	O
this	O
,	O
he	O
said	O
at	O
last	O
.	O

There	O
was	O
something	O
in	O
that	O
case	O
...	O
some	O
piece	O
of	O
evidence	O
,	O
slight	O
in	O
itself	O
perhaps	O
,	O
but	O
still	O
enough	O
of	O
a	O
clue	O
to	O
connect	O
the	O
murderer	O
with	O
the	O
crime	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
vital	O
to	O
him	O
that	O
it	O
should	O
be	O
destroyed	O
before	O
it	O
was	O
discovered	O
and	O
its	O
significance	O
appreciated	O
.	O

Therefore	O
,	O
he	O
took	O
the	O
risk	O
,	O
the	O
great	O
risk	O
,	O
of	O
coming	O
in	O
here	O
.	O

Finding	O
the	O
case	O
locked	O
,	O
he	O
was	O
obliged	O
to	O
force	O
it	O
,	O
thus	O
betraying	O
his	O
presence	O
.	O

For	O
him	O
to	O
take	O
that	O
risk	O

it	O
must	O
have	O

something	O
of	O

Oh	O

John	B-PER

Something	O

I	O

the	O

I	O
do	O

what	O

I	O
was	O

Dr	B-PER
Bauerstein	I-PER

Instantly	O
I	O
regretted	O
my	O

Her	O

I	O
had	O
the	O
impression	O
of	O
a	O

down	O

she	O
turned	O

went	O

up	O

whilst	O
I	O
stood	O
like	O

gaping	O
after	O

I	O
was	O
recalled	O
to	O

I	O
could	O
hear	O
Poirot	B-PER
shouting	O

I	O
was	O
vexed	O
to	O
think	O
that	O
my	O

The	O

I	O

for	O

Once	O
again	O
I	O
could	O
not	O

so	O
prone	O

I	O
stepped	O
briskly	O
down	O
the	O

The	O
sight	O
of	O

calmed	O
Poirot	B-PER
almost	O
immediately	O

I	O
drew	O
him	O
aside	O

My	O
dear	O

I	O
said	O

is	O
this	O

Surely	O

A	O

The	O

Oh	O

I	O
did	O

Poirot	B-PER
produced	O
the	O

Can	O

As	O
we	O
walked	O
briskly	O
away	O
from	O
the	O
house	O

I	O
glanced	O
at	O
him	O
more	O
than	O
once	O

I	O
had	O
often	O
before	O
noticed	O
that	O

if	O
anything	O
excited	O
him	O
,	O
his	O
eyes	O
turned	O
green	O

They	O

My	O

he	O
broke	O
out	O
at	O

,	O
I	O
have	O
a	O
little	O
idea	O
,	O
a	O
very	O
strange	O
,	O
and	O
probably	O
utterly	O
impossible	O
idea	O

And	O
yet	O
...	O
it	O
fits	O
in	O

I	O
shrugged	O
my	O
shoulders	O

I	O
privately	O
thought	O
that	O
Poirot	B-PER
was	O
rather	O
too	O
much	O
given	O
to	O
these	O
fantastic	O
ideas	O

In	O
this	O

,	O
surely	O
,	O
the	O
truth	O
was	O
only	O
too	O
plain	O

So	O
that	O
is	O
the	O
explanation	O
of	O
the	O
blank	O
label	O
on	O
the	O
box	O
,	O
I	O
remarked	O

Very	O
simple	O
,	O
as	O
you	O
said	O

I	O
really	O
wonder	O
that	O
I	O
did	O
not	O

it	O
myself	O

Poirot	B-PER
did	O
not	O
appear	O

Mr.	B-PER
Wells	I-PER
told	O
me	O
as	O
we	O
were	O
going	O
upstairs	O

What	O
was	O
it	O
?	O

Locked	O
up	O
in	O
the	O

in	O
the	O
boudoir	O

they	O

a	O

Mrs.	B-PER

dated	O
before	O
her	O
marriage	O

leaving	O
her	O
fortune	O
to	O
Alfred	B-PER
Inglethorp	I-PER

It	O
must	O
have	O
been	O
made	O
just	O
at	O
the	O
time	O
they	O
were	O
engaged	O

It	O
came	O
quite	O
as	O
a	O
surprise	O
to	O
Wells	B-PER
...	O
and	O
to	O
John	B-PER
Cavendish	I-PER
also	O

It	O
was	O
written	O
on	O
one	O

witnessed	O

Did	O
Mr.	B-PER

One	O

I	O
remarked	O

All	O
these	O

very	O

Tell	O

Well	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
what	O
Mrs.	B-PER

did	O

You	O
will	O
notice	O
that	O
the	O

Now	O
,	O
what	O
did	O
that	O
tell	O

It	O
told	O

that	O
Mrs.	B-PER

had	O
been	O
writing	O
the	O
word	O
`	O

that	O
afternoon	O

and	O
,	O
having	O
the	O
fragment	O
of	O

found	O
in	O
the	O

fresh	O
in	O
my	O
mind	O

the	O
possibility	O
of	O
a	O

-LRB-	O
a	O
document	O
almost	O

occurred	O
to	O

at	O

This	O
possibility	O
was	O
confirmed	O
by	O
a	O
further	O
circumstance	O

In	O
the	O
general	O
confusion	O
,	O
the	O
boudoir	O
had	O
not	O
been	O
swept	O
that	O
morning	O
,	O
and	O
near	O
the	O
desk	O
were	O
several	O
traces	O
of	O
brown	O
mould	O
and	O
earth	O

The	O
weather	O
had	O
been	O
perfectly	O
fine	O
for	O
some	O
days	O
,	O
and	O
no	O
ordinary	O
boots	O
would	O
have	O
left	O
such	O
a	O
heavy	O
deposit	O

I	O
strolled	O
to	O
the	O
window	O
,	O
and	O
saw	O
at	O
once	O
that	O
the	O
begonia	O
beds	O
had	O
been	O
newly	O
planted	O
.	O

The	O
mould	O
in	O
the	O
beds	O
was	O
exactly	O
similar	O
to	O
that	O
on	O
the	O
floor	O
of	O
the	O
boudoir	O
,	O
and	O
also	O
I	O
learnt	O
from	O
you	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
been	O
planted	O
yesterday	O
afternoon	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
now	O
sure	O
that	O
one	O
,	O
or	O
possibly	O
both	O
of	O
the	O
gardeners	O
...	O
for	O
there	O
were	O
two	O
sets	O
of	O
footprints	O
in	O
the	O
bed	O
...	O
had	O
entered	O
the	O
boudoir	O
,	O
for	O
if	O
Mrs.	B-PER
Inglethorp	I-PER
had	O
merely	O
wished	O
to	O
speak	O
to	O
them	O
she	O
would	O
in	O
all	O
probability	O
have	O
stood	O
at	O
the	O
window	O
,	O
and	O
they	O
would	O
not	O
have	O
come	O
into	O
the	O
room	O
at	O
all	O

I	O
was	O
now	O
quite	O
convinced	O
that	O
she	O
had	O
made	O
a	O
fresh	O
will	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
called	O
the	O
two	O
gardeners	O
in	O
to	O
witness	O
her	O
signature	O

Events	O
proved	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
right	O
in	O
my	O
supposition	O
.	O

That	O
was	O
very	O
ingenious	O
,	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
help	O
admitting	O
.	O

I	O
must	O
confess	O
that	O
the	O
conclusions	O
I	O
drew	O
from	O
those	O
few	O
scribbled	O
words	O
were	O
quite	O
erroneous	O

He	O
smiled	O
.	O

You	O
gave	O
too	O
much	O
rein	O
to	O
your	O
imagination	O

Imagination	O
is	O
a	O
good	O
servant	O

and	O
a	O
bad	O
master	O

The	O
simplest	O
explanation	O
is	O
always	O
the	O
most	O
likely	O

Another	O
point	O

how	O
did	O
you	O
know	O
that	O
the	O
key	O

the	O
despatch-case	O

I	O
did	O
not	O

it	O

It	O
was	O
a	O
guess	O
that	O
turned	O
out	O
to	O
be	O
correct	O

You	O
observed	O
that	O
it	O
had	O
a	O
piece	O
of	O

wire	O
through	O
the	O

That	O

it	O
had	O
possibly	O
been	O
wrenched	O
off	O
a	O

``	O
Now	O
,	O
if	O
it	O

You	O

of	O

,	O
naturally	O

Every	O

to	O

it	O

On	O

have	O

the	O

point	O
that	O
to	O
my	O
mind	O
tells	O
against	O

How	O
is	O
that	O

His	O

This	O
Mr.	B-PER

Now	O
let	O
us	O
turn	O
to	O
other	O
aspects	O
of	O
the	O
case	O

What	O
do	O
you	O
make	O
of	O
the	O
fact	O

the	O
conviction	O
that	O
the	O

The	O

John	B-PER
Cavendish	I-PER
gave	O
evidence	O
of	O
identification	O

Further	O
questioned	O

the	O

There	O
was	O
a	O

In	O
a	O
few	O
brief	O
words	O
,	O
he	O
summed	O
up	O
the	O
result	O

the	O
post-mortem	O
.	O

Shorn	O
of	O
its	O
medical	O
phraseology	O

technicalities	O
,	O
it	O
amounted	O
to	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
Mrs.	B-PER
Inglethorp	I-PER
had	O
met	O
her	O
death	O
as	O
the	O
result	O
of	O
strychnine	O
poisoning	O
.	O

Judging	O
from	O
the	O
quantity	O
recovered	O
,	O
she	O
must	O
have	O
taken	O
not	O
less	O
than	O
three-quarters	O
of	O
a	O
grain	O
of	O
strychnine	O
,	O
but	O
probably	O
one	O

Is	O
it	O
possible	O
that	O
she	O
could	O
have	O
swallowed	O
the	O
poison	O
by	O
accident	O
?	O

asked	O
the	O
Coroner	O
.	O

I	O
should	O
consider	O
it	O
very	O
unlikely	O
.	O

Strychnine	O
is	O
not	O
used	O
for	O
domestic	O
purposes	O

anything	O
in	O

how	O
the	O

No	O

She	O
was	O
at	O
that	O
moment	O
in	O
a	O
typical	O
tetanic	O
convulsion	O

She	O
turned	O

Could	O
the	O
strychnine	O
have	O
been	O
administered	O
in	O
Mrs.	B-PER
Inglethorp	I-PER
's	O
after-dinner	O
coffee	O
which	O
was	O
taken	O
to	O
her	O
by	O
her	O
husband	O
?	O

Possibly	O
,	O
but	O
strychnine	O
is	O
a	O
fairly	O
rapid	O
drug	O
in	O
its	O
action	O
.	O

The	O
symptoms	O
appear	O
from	O
one	O
to	O
two	O
hours	O
after	O
it	O
has	O
been	O
swallowed	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
retarded	O
under	O
certain	O
conditions	O
,	O
none	O
of	O
which	O
,	O
however	O
,	O
appear	O

been	O
present	O
in	O
this	O
case	O

I	O
presume	O
Mrs.	B-PER
Inglethorp	I-PER
took	O
the	O
coffee	O
after	O
dinner	O
about	O
eight	O
o'clock	O
,	O
whereas	O
the	O
symptoms	O
did	O
not	O
manifest	O
themselves	O
until	O
the	O
early	O
hours	O
of	O
the	O
morning	O
,	O
which	O
,	O
on	O
the	O
face	O
of	O
it	O
,	O
points	O
to	O
the	O
drug	O
having	O
been	O
taken	O
much	O
later	O
in	O
the	O
evening	O
.	O

Mrs.	B-PER
Inglethorp	I-PER
was	O
in	O
the	O
habit	O
of	O
drinking	O
a	O
cup	O
of	O
cocoa	O
in	O
the	O
middle	O
of	O
the	O
night	O
.	O

Could	O
the	O
strychnine	O
have	O
been	O
administered	O
in	O
that	O
?	O

No	O
,	O
I	O
myself	O
took	O
a	O
sample	O
of	O
the	O
cocoa	O
remaining	O
in	O
the	O
saucepan	O
and	O
had	O
it	O
analysed	O
.	O

There	O
was	O
no	O
strychnine	O
present	O
.	O

I	O
heard	O
Poirot	B-PER
chuckle	O
softly	O
beside	O
me	O
.	O

How	O
did	O
you	O
know	O
?	O

I	O
whispered	O
.	O

Listen	O
.	O

I	O
should	O
say	O
...	O
the	O
doctor	O
was	O
continuing	O
...	O
that	O
I	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
considerably	O
surprised	O
at	O
any	O
other	O
result	O
.	O

Why	O
?	O

Simply	O
because	O
strychnine	O
has	O
an	O
unusually	O
bitter	O
taste	O
.	O

It	O
can	O
be	O
detected	O
in	O
a	O
solution	O
of	O
1	O
in	O
70,000	O
,	O
and	O
can	O
only	O
be	O
disguised	O
by	O
some	O
strongly	O
flavoured	O
substance	O
.	O

cocoa	O
would	O
be	O
quite	O
powerless	O
to	O
mask	O
it	O
.	O

One	O
of	O
the	O
jury	O
wanted	O
to	O
know	O
if	O
the	O
same	O
objection	O
applied	O
to	O
coffee	O
.	O

No	O
.	O

Coffee	O
has	O
a	O
bitter	O
taste	O
of	O
its	O
own	O
which	O
would	O
probably	O
cover	O
the	O
taste	O
of	O
strychnine	O
.	O

Then	O
you	O
consider	O
it	O
more	O
likely	O
that	O
the	O
drug	O
was	O
administered	O
in	O
the	O
coffee	O
,	O
but	O
that	O
for	O
some	O
unknown	O
reason	O
its	O
action	O
was	O
delayed	O
.	O

Yes	O
,	O
but	O
,	O
the	O
cup	O
being	O
completely	O
smashed	O
,	O
there	O
is	O
no	O
possibility	O
of	O
analyzing	O
its	O
contents	O
.	O

This	O
concluded	O
Dr	B-PER
Bauerstein	I-PER
's	O
evidence	O
.	O

Dr	B-PER
Wilkins	I-PER
corroborated	O
it	O
on	O
all	O
points	O
.	O

Sounded	O
as	O
to	O
the	O
possibility	O
of	O
suicide	O
,	O
he	O
repudiated	O
it	O
utterly	O
.	O

The	O
deceased	O
,	O
he	O
said	O
,	O
suffered	O
from	O
a	O
weak	O
heart	O
,	O
but	O
otherwise	O
enjoyed	O
perfect	O
health	O
,	O
and	O
was	O
of	O
a	O
cheerful	O
and	O
well-balanced	O
disposition	O
.	O

She	O
would	O
be	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
last	O
people	O
to	O
take	O
her	O
own	O
life	O
.	O

Lawrence	B-PER
Cavendish	I-PER
was	O
next	O
called	O
.	O

His	O
evidence	O
was	O
quite	O
unimportant	O
,	O
being	O
a	O
mere	O
repetition	O
of	O
that	O
of	O
his	O
brother	O
.	O

Just	O
as	O
he	O
was	O
about	O
to	O
step	O
down	O
,	O
he	O
paused	O
,	O
and	O
said	O
rather	O
hesitatingly	O
:	O
I	O
should	O
like	O
to	O
make	O
a	O
suggestion	O
if	O
I	O
may	O
?	O

He	O
glanced	O
deprecatingly	O
at	O
the	O
Coroner	O
,	O
who	O
replied	O
briskly	O
:	O
Certainly	O
,	O
Mr.	B-PER
Cavendish	I-PER
,	O
we	O
are	O
here	O
to	O
arrive	O
at	O
the	O
truth	O
of	O
this	O
matter	O
,	O
and	O
welcome	O
anything	O
that	O
may	O
lead	O
to	O
further	O
elucidation	O
.	O

It	O
is	O
just	O
an	O
idea	O
of	O
mine	O
,	O
explained	O
Lawrence	B-PER
.	O

Of	O
course	O
I	O
may	O
be	O
quite	O
wrong	O
,	O
but	O
it	O
still	O
seems	O
to	O
me	O
that	O
my	O
mother	O
's	O
death	O
might	O
be	O
accounted	O
for	O
by	O
natural	O
means	O
.	O

How	O
do	O
you	O
make	O
that	O
out	O
,	O
Mr.	B-PER
Cavendish	I-PER
?	O

My	O
mother	O
,	O
at	O
the	O
time	O
of	O
her	O
death	O
,	O
and	O
for	O
some	O
time	O
before	O
it	O
,	O
was	O
taking	O
a	O
tonic	O
containing	O
strychnine	O
.	O

Ah	O
!	O

said	O
the	O
Coroner	O
.	O

The	O
jury	O
looked	O
up	O
,	O
interested	O
.	O

I	O
believe	O
,	O
continued	O
Lawrence	B-PER
,	O
that	O
there	O
have	O
been	O
cases	O
where	O
the	O
cumulative	O
effect	O
of	O
a	O
drug	O
,	O
administered	O
for	O
some	O
time	O
,	O
has	O
ended	O
by	O
causing	O
death	O
.	O

Also	O
,	O
is	O
it	O
not	O
possible	O
that	O
she	O
may	O
have	O
taken	O
an	O
overdose	O
of	O
her	O
medicine	O
by	O
accident	O
?	O

This	O
is	O
the	O
first	O
we	O
have	O
heard	O
of	O
the	O
deceased	O
taking	O
strychnine	O
at	O
the	O
time	O
of	O
her	O
death	O
.	O

We	O
are	O
much	O
obliged	O
to	O
you	O
,	O
Mr.	B-PER
Cavendish	I-PER
.	O

Dr	B-PER
Wilkins	I-PER
was	O
recalled	O
and	O
ridiculed	O
the	O
idea	O
.	O

What	O
Mr.	B-PER
Cavendish	I-PER
suggests	O
is	O
quite	O
impossible	O
.	O

Any	O
doctor	O
would	O
tell	O
you	O
the	O
same	O
.	O

Strychnine	O
is	O
,	O
in	O
a	O
certain	O
sense	O
,	O
a	O
cumulative	O
poison	O
,	O
but	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
quite	O
impossible	O
for	O
it	O
to	O
result	O
in	O
sudden	O
death	O
in	O
this	O
way	O
.	O

There	O
would	O
have	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
long	O
period	O
of	O
chronic	O
symptoms	O
which	O
would	O
at	O
once	O
have	O
attracted	O
my	O
attention	O
.	O

The	O
whole	O
thing	O
is	O
absurd	O
.	O

And	O
the	O
second	O
suggestion	O
?	O

That	O
Mrs.	B-PER
Inglethorp	I-PER
may	O
have	O
inadvertently	O
taken	O
an	O
overdose	O
?	O

Three	O
,	O
or	O
even	O
four	O
doses	O
,	O
would	O
not	O
have	O
resulted	O
in	O
death	O
.	O

Mrs.	B-PER
Inglethorp	I-PER
always	O
had	O
an	O
extra	O
large	O
amount	O
of	O
medicine	O
made	O
up	O
at	O
a	O
time	O
,	O
as	O
she	O
dealt	O
with	O
Coot	O
's	O
,	O
the	O
Cash	B-ORG
Chemists	I-ORG
in	O
Tadminster	B-LOC
.	O

She	O
would	O
have	O
had	O
to	O
take	O
very	O
nearly	O
the	O
whole	O
bottle	O
to	O
account	O
for	O
the	O
amount	O
of	O
strychnine	O
found	O
at	O
the	O
post-mortem	O
.	O

Then	O
you	O
consider	O
that	O
we	O
may	O
dismiss	O
the	O
tonic	O
as	O
not	O
being	O
in	O
any	O
way	O
instrumental	O
in	O
causing	O
her	O
death	O
?	O

Certainly	O
.	O

The	O
supposition	O
is	O
ridiculous	O
.	O

The	O
same	O
juryman	O
who	O
had	O
interrupted	O
before	O
here	O
suggested	O
that	O
the	O
chemist	O
who	O
made	O
up	O
the	O
medicine	O
might	O
have	O
committed	O
an	O
error	O
.	O

That	O
,	O
of	O
course	O
,	O
is	O
always	O
possible	O
,	O
replied	O
the	O
doctor	O
.	O

But	O
Dorcas	B-PER
,	O
who	O
was	O
the	O
next	O
witness	O
called	O
,	O
dispelled	O
even	O
that	O
possibility	O
.	O

The	O
medicine	O
had	O
not	O
been	O
newly	O
made	O
up	O
.	O

On	O
the	O
contrary	O
,	O
Mrs.	B-PER
Inglethorp	I-PER
had	O
taken	O
the	O
last	O
dose	O
on	O
the	O
day	O
of	O
her	O
death	O
.	O

So	O
the	O
question	O
of	O
the	O
tonic	O
was	O
finally	O
abandoned	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
Coroner	O
proceeded	O
with	O
his	O
task	O
.	O

Having	O
elicited	O
from	O
Dorcas	B-PER
how	O
she	O
had	O
been	O
awakened	O
by	O
the	O
violent	O
ringing	O
of	O
her	O
mistress	O
's	O
bell	O
,	O
and	O
had	O
subsequently	O
roused	O
the	O
household	O
,	O
he	O
passed	O
to	O
the	O
subject	O
of	O
the	O
quarrel	O
on	O
the	O
preceding	O
afternoon	O
.	O

Dorcas	B-PER
's	O
evidence	O
on	O
this	O
point	O
was	O
substantially	O
what	O
Poirot	B-PER
and	O
I	O
had	O
already	O
heard	O
,	O
so	O
I	O
will	O
not	O
repeat	O
it	O
here	O
.	O

The	O
next	O
witness	O
was	O
Mary	B-PER
Cavendish	I-PER
.	O

She	O
stood	O
very	O
upright	O
,	O
and	O
spoke	O
in	O
a	O
low	O
,	O
clear	O
,	O
and	O
perfectly	O
composed	O
voice	O
.	O

In	O
answer	O
to	O
the	O
Coroner	O

question	O
,	O
she	O
told	O
how	O

her	O
alarm	O

having	O
aroused	O
her	O
at	O
4.3	O
as	O
usual	O

when	O
she	O
was	O
startled	O
by	O
the	O
sound	O
of	O
something	O
heavy	O

That	O
would	O
have	O
been	O

table	O

commented	O
the	O
Coroner	O

I	O
opened	O
my	O
door	O
,	O
continued	O
Mary	B-PER
,	O
and	O
listened	O
.	O

In	O
a	O
few	O
minutes	O
a	O
bell	O
rang	O
violently	O
.	O

Dorcas	B-PER
came	O
running	O
down	O
and	O
woke	O
my	O
husband	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
all	O
went	O
to	O
my	O
mother-in-law	O
's	O
mother-in-law	O
's	O
room	O
,	O
but	O
it	O
was	O
locked	O
...	O
.	O

The	O
Coroner	O
interrupted	O
her	O
.	O

I	O
really	O
do	O
not	O
think	O
we	O
need	O
trouble	O
you	O
further	O
on	O
that	O
point	O
.	O

We	O
know	O
all	O
that	O
can	O
be	O
known	O
of	O
the	O
subsequent	O
happenings	O

But	O
I	O
should	O
be	O
obliged	O
if	O
you	O
would	O
tell	O
us	O
all	O
you	O
overheard	O
of	O
the	O
quarrel	O
the	O
day	O
before	O
.	O

I	O
?	O

There	O
was	O
a	O
faint	O
insolence	O
in	O
her	O
voice	O
.	O

She	O
raised	O
her	O
hand	O
and	O
adjusted	O
the	O
ruffle	O
of	O
lace	O
at	O
her	O
neck	O
,	O
turning	O
her	O
head	O
a	O
little	O
as	O
she	O
did	O
so	O
.	O

And	O
quite	O
spontaneously	O
the	O
thought	O
flashed	O
across	O
my	O
mind	O
:	O
She	O
is	O
gaining	O
time	O
!	O

Yes	O
.	O

I	O
understand	O
,	O
continued	O
the	O
Coroner	O
deliberately	O
,	O
that	O
you	O
were	O
sitting	O
reading	O
on	O
the	O
bench	O
just	O
outside	O
the	O
long	O
window	O
of	O
the	O
boudoir	O

That	O
is	O
so	O
,	O
is	O
it	O
not	O
?	O

This	O
was	O
news	O
to	O
me	O
and	O
glancing	O
sideways	O
at	O
Poirot	B-PER
,	O
I	O
fancied	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
news	O
to	O
him	O
as	O
well	O
.	O

There	O
was	O
the	O
faintest	O
pause	O
,	O
the	O
mere	O
hesitation	O
of	O
a	O
moment	O
,	O
before	O
she	O
answered	O
:	O
Yes	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
so	O
.	O

And	O
the	O
boudoir	O
window	O
was	O
open	O
,	O
was	O
it	O
not	O
?	O

Surely	O
her	O
face	O
grew	O
a	O
little	O
paler	O
as	O
she	O
answered	O
:	O
Yes	O
.	O

Then	O
you	O
can	O
not	O
have	O
failed	O
to	O
hear	O
the	O
voices	O
inside	O
,	O
especially	O
as	O
they	O
were	O
raised	O
in	O
anger	O

In	O
fact	O

they	O
would	O
be	O
more	O
audible	O
where	O
you	O
were	O
than	O
in	O
the	O

Possibly	O

Will	O
you	O
repeat	O
to	O
us	O
what	O
you	O
overheard	O
of	O
the	O
quarrel	O
?	O

I	O
really	O

Do	O
you	O

Oh	O

yes	O

I	O
heard	O
the	O

I	O

A	O

The	O

In	O
answer	O
to	O
the	O
Coroner	O

questions	O

he	O

amidst	O
a	O

Alfred	B-PER

was	O
called	O

Did	O
he	O

I	O
wondered	O

how	O
closely	O
the	O

The	O

went	O
straight	O

On	O

Inglethorp	B-PER

The	O

the	O

his	O

Certainly	O

your	O

Mr.	B-PER

Mr.	B-PER

Mr.	B-PER

the	O

Inglethorp	B-PER

That	O
is	O
a	O

the	O
Coroner	O
dryly	O

I	O
am	O
to	O
take	O
it	O
then	O
that	O
you	O

the	O

that	O
Mr.	B-PER

Inglethorp	B-PER

it	O
is	O

The	O
Coroner	O
reflected	O
a	O
moment	O
,	O
then	O
he	O
said	O
:	O
I	O
believe	O
,	O
Mr.	B-PER
Inglethorp	I-PER
,	O
that	O
you	O
yourself	O
poured	O
out	O
the	O
coffee	O
,	O
and	O
took	O
it	O
to	O
your	O
wife	O
that	O
evening	O
?	O

I	O
poured	O
it	O
out	O
,	O
yes	O
.	O

But	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
take	O
it	O
to	O
her	O
.	O

I	O
meant	O
to	O
do	O
so	O
,	O
but	O
I	O
was	O
told	O
that	O
a	O
friend	O
was	O
at	O
the	O
hall	O
door	O
,	O
so	O
I	O
laid	O
down	O
the	O
coffee	O
on	O
the	O

When	O
I	O
came	O
through	O
the	O
hall	O
again	O
a	O
few	O

it	O
was	O

This	O
statement	O
might	O
,	O
or	O
might	O
not	O
,	O
be	O
TRUE	O

but	O
it	O
did	O
not	O
seem	O

me	O

matters	O
much	O
for	O
Inglethorp	B-PER

In	O
any	O

At	O

Poirot	B-PER
nudged	O

He	O
put	O
his	O

Do	O

There	O

nothing	O

Well	O

Well	O

I	O
learnt	O
that	O

on	O

duty	O
on	O
Tuesday	O

and	O
that	O

a	O

said	O

rather	O
nonplussed	O

Really	O
,	O
I	O
continued	O
,	O
it	O
's	O
her	O
extraordinary	O
vehemence	O
against	O
Inglethorp	B-PER
that	O
started	O
me	O
off	O

her	O

I	O
ca	O
n't	O
help	O
feeling	O
she	O
'd	O
do	O
anything	O
against	O
him	O

And	O
I	O
had	O
an	O
idea	O
she	O
might	O
know	O
something	O
about	O
the	O
destroying	O
of	O
the	O

She	O
might	O

it	O

the	O

She	O
is	O
so	O
terribly	O
bitter	O
against	O

You	O
consider	O
her	O
vehemence	O
unnatural	O
?	O

Y.	O
.	O

es	O
.	O

She	O
is	O
so	O

I	O
wondered	O

whether	O
she	O
is	O
quite	O
sane	O
on	O

point	O

Poirot	B-PER
shook	O
his	O

No	O
,	O
no	O
,	O
you	O
are	O
on	O
a	O
wrong	O
tack	O
there	O
.	O

There	O
is	O
nothing	O
weak-minded	O
or	O
degenerate	O
about	O
Miss	B-PER
Howard	I-PER
.	O

She	O
is	O
an	O
excellent	O
specimen	O
of	O
well-balanced	O
English	O
beef	O

.	O

She	O
is	O
sanity	O
itself	O
.	O

Yet	O
her	O
hatred	O
of	O
Inglethorp	B-PER
seems	O
almost	O
a	O
mania	O
.	O

My	O
idea	O
was	O
...	O
a	O
very	O
ridiculous	O
one	O
,	O
no	O
doubt	O
...	O
that	O
she	O
had	O
intended	O
to	O
poison	O
him	O
...	O

that	O
,	O
in	O
some	O
way	O
,	O
Mrs.	B-PER
Inglethorp	I-PER

do	O
n't	O
at	O
all	O

how	O
it	O

The	O
whole	O
thing	O
is	O
absurd	O
and	O
ridiculous	O
to	O
the	O
last	O
degree	O

Still	O
you	O
are	O
right	O
in	O
one	O
thing	O

It	O
is	O
always	O
wise	O
to	O
suspect	O

until	O
you	O

and	O
to	O
your	O

satisfaction	O

that	O
they	O
are	O

Now	O

what	O
reasons	O
are	O
there	O
against	O
Miss	B-PER
Howard	I-PER
's	O
having	O
deliberately	O
poisoned	O
Mrs.	B-PER
Inglethorp	I-PER

Why	O

she	O
was	O
devoted	O

her	O

I	O
exclaimed	O

Tcha	O
!	O

Tcha	O

cried	O
Poirot	B-PER
irritably	O

You	O
argue	O

If	O
Miss	B-PER
Howard	I-PER
were	O
capable	O
of	O
poisoning	O
the	O
old	O
lady	O

she	O
would	O
be	O
quite	O
equally	O
capable	O
of	O
simulating	O
devotion	O

No	O

we	O
must	O
look	O
elsewhere	O

``	O
You	O
are	O
perfectly	O
correct	O
in	O
your	O

against	O
Alfred	B-PER
Inglethorp	I-PER
is	O
too	O
violent	O
to	O
be	O
natural	O

you	O
are	O

wrong	O
in	O

Now	O
there	O

no	O

reflected	O

Mrs.	B-PER

Poirot	B-PER
smiled	O

That	O

Miss	B-PER

occupied	O
very	O
much	O
the	O

so	O
I	O
used	O
her	O

instead	O

Still	O
,	O
Mrs.	B-PER
Inglethorp	I-PER
might	O

that	O

It	O

Do	O

that	O
Mrs.	B-PER

What	O

Arsenic	O

Miss	B-PER
Howard	I-PER

do	O
you	O

there	O
is	O
a	O
sentence	O
of	O
yours	O
that	O
has	O
impressed	O
me	O
very	O

Do	O
you	O

affirming	O
that	O

and	O
anyone	O

Alfred	B-PER
Inglethorp	I-PER

No	O

you	O

If	O

nothing	O

then	O
,	O
suddenly	O

a	O
dreadful	O
possibility	O
flashed	O
through	O
my	O
mind	O

I	O
hoped	O

prayed	O
it	O

I	O
glanced	O
sideways	O

and	O
I	O
drew	O
a	O
deep	O
breath	O
of	O
relief	O

for	O
the	O
terrible	O
thought	O
that	O
had	O

across	O
my	O

this	O
:	O
that	O
Dr	B-PER

might	O
have	O
had	O
an	O
accomplice	O

Yet	O

it	O

Surely	O
no	O

Mary	B-PER

Yet	O
beautiful	O

had	O
been	O

And	O
suddenly	O
I	O
remembered	O
that	O
first	O
conversation	O
at	O

on	O
the	O
day	O
of	O
my	O
arrival	O

and	O
the	O
gleam	O

that	O
poison	O
was	O
a	O

How	O
agitated	O
she	O
had	O
been	O
on	O
that	O

Had	O
Mrs.	B-PER
Inglethorp	I-PER
discovered	O
something	O
between	O
her	O

Bauerstein	B-PER

and	O
threatened	O
to	O
tell	O
her	O
husband	O

Was	O
it	O
to	O
stop	O
that	O
denunciation	O
that	O
the	O
crime	O
had	O
been	O
committed	O
?	O

Then	O
I	O
remembered	O
that	O
enigmatical	O
conversation	O
between	O
Poirot	B-PER

Evelyn	B-PER
Howard	I-PER

Was	O
this	O
what	O
they	O
had	O
meant	O

Was	O
this	O
the	O
monstrous	O
possibility	O
that	O
Evelyn	B-PER
had	O
tried	O
not	O
to	O
believe	O

Yes	O

it	O
all	O
fitted	O

No	O

Miss	B-PER
Howard	I-PER
had	O
suggested	O
hushing	O
it	O
up	O

that	O
unfinished	O
sentence	O
of	O
hers	O

Emily	B-PER
herself	O

in	O
my	O

I	O
agreed	O
with	O
her	O

Would	O
not	O
Mrs.	B-PER
Inglethorp	I-PER
have	O
preferred	O
to	O
go	O

dishonour	O
fall	O

There	O
's	O
another	O
thing	O
,	O
said	O
John	B-PER
suddenly	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
unexpected	O
sound	O
of	O
his	O
voice	O
made	O
me	O
start	O
guiltily	O
.	O

Something	O
which	O
makes	O
me	O
doubt	O
if	O
what	O
you	O
say	O
can	O
be	O
TRUE	O
.	O

What	O
's	O
that	O
?	O

I	O
asked	O
,	O
thankful	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
gone	O
away	O
from	O
the	O
subject	O
of	O
how	O
the	O
poison	O
could	O
have	O
been	O
introduced	O
into	O
the	O
cocoa	O

Why	O
,	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
Bauerstein	B-PER
demanded	O
a	O
post-mortem	O
.	O

He	O
need	O
n't	O
have	O
done	O
so	O
.	O

Little	O
Wilkins	B-PER
would	O
have	O
been	O
quite	O
content	O
to	O
let	O
it	O
go	O
at	O
heart	O
disease	O
.	O

Yes	O
,	O
I	O
said	O
doubtfully	O
.	O

But	O
we	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
.	O

Perhaps	O
he	O
thought	O
it	O
safer	O
in	O
the	O
long	O
run	O
.	O

Some	O
one	O
might	O
have	O
talked	O
afterwards	O
.	O

Then	O
the	O
Home	B-ORG
Office	I-ORG
might	O
have	O
ordered	O
exhumation	O
.	O

The	O
whole	O
thing	O
would	O
have	O
come	O
out	O
,	O
then	O
,	O
and	O
he	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
in	O
an	O
awkward	O
position	O
,	O
for	O
no	O
one	O
would	O
have	O
believed	O
that	O
a	O
man	O
of	O
his	O
reputation	O
could	O
have	O
been	O
deceived	O
into	O
calling	O
it	O
heart	O
disease	O
.	O

Yes	O
,	O
that	O
's	O
possible	O
,	O
admitted	O
John	B-PER
.	O

Still	O
,	O
he	O
added	O
,	O
I	O
'm	O
blest	O
if	O
I	O
can	O
see	O
what	O
his	O
motive	O
could	O
have	O
been	O
.	O

I	O
trembled	O
.	O

Look	O
here	O
,	O
I	O
said	O
,	O
I	O
may	O
be	O
altogether	O
wrong	O
.	O

And	O
,	O
remember	O

all	O
this	O
is	O
in	O
confidence	O

Oh	O
,	O
of	O
course	O
...	O
that	O
goes	O
without	O

We	O
had	O
walked	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
talked	O
,	O
and	O
now	O
we	O
passed	O
through	O
the	O
little	O

into	O
the	O
garden	O

Voices	O
rose	O
near	O
at	O

for	O

was	O
spread	O
out	O
under	O

as	O
it	O
had	O
been	O
on	O
the	O
day	O
of	O
my	O
arrival	O

Cynthia	B-PER
was	O
back	O
from	O
the	O
hospital	O

and	O
I	O
placed	O
my	O
chair	O
beside	O
her	O

and	O
told	O
her	O
of	O
Poirot	B-PER
's	O
wish	O
to	O
visit	O
the	O
dispensary	O

Of	O
course	O

I	O
'd	O
love	O
him	O

it	O

He	O
'd	O
better	O
come	O
to	O
tea	O
there	O
one	O
day	O
.	O

I	O
must	O
fix	O
it	O
up	O
with	O
him	O

He	O
's	O
such	O
a	O
dear	O
little	O
man	O
!	O

But	O
he	O
is	O
funny	O
.	O

He	O
made	O
me	O
take	O
the	O
brooch	O
out	O
of	O
my	O
tie	O
the	O
other	O
day	O
,	O
and	O
put	O
it	O
in	O
again	O
,	O
because	O
he	O
said	O
it	O
was	O
n't	O
straight	O
.	O

I	O
laughed	O
.	O

It	O
's	O
quite	O
a	O
mania	O
with	O
him	O
.	O

Yes	O
,	O
is	O
n't	O
it	O
?	O

We	O
were	O
silent	O
for	O
a	O
minute	O
or	O
two	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
,	O
glancing	O
in	O
the	O
direction	O
of	O
Mary	B-PER
Cavendish	I-PER
,	O
and	O
dropping	O
her	O
voice	O
,	O
Cynthia	B-PER
said	O
:	O
Mr.	B-PER
Hastings	I-PER
.	O

Yes	O
?	O

After	O
tea	O
,	O
I	O
want	O
to	O
talk	O
to	O
you	O
.	O

Her	O
glance	O
at	O
Mary	B-PER
had	O
set	O
me	O
thinking	O
.	O

I	O
fancied	O
that	O
between	O
these	O
two	O
there	O
existed	O
very	O
little	O
sympathy	O
.	O

For	O
the	O
first	O
time	O
,	O
it	O
occurred	O
to	O
me	O
to	O
wonder	O
about	O
the	O
girl	O
's	O
future	O
.	O

Mrs.	B-PER
Inglethorp	I-PER
had	O
made	O
no	O
provisions	O
of	O
any	O
kind	O
for	O
her	O
,	O
but	O
I	O
imagined	O
that	O
John	B-PER
and	O
Mary	B-PER
would	O
probably	O
insist	O
on	O
her	O
making	O
her	O
home	O
with	O
them	O
...	O
at	O
any	O
rate	O
until	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
the	O
war	O
.	O

John	B-PER
,	O
I	O
knew	O
,	O
was	O
very	O
fond	O
of	O
her	O
,	O
and	O
would	O
be	O
sorry	O
to	O
let	O
her	O
go	O
.	O

John	B-PER
,	O
who	O
had	O
gone	O
into	O
the	O
house	O
,	O
now	O
reappeared	O
.	O

His	O
good-natured	O
face	O
wore	O
an	O
unaccustomed	O
frown	O
of	O
anger	O
.	O

Confound	O
those	O
detectives	O
!	O

I	O
ca	O
n't	O
think	O
what	O
they	O
're	O
after	O
!	O

They	O
've	O
been	O
in	O
every	O
room	O
in	O
the	O
house	O
...	O
turning	O
things	O
inside	O
out	O
,	O
and	O
upside	O
down	O

It	O
really	O
is	O
too	O
bad	O
!	O

I	O
suppose	O
they	O
took	O
advantage	O
of	O
our	O
all	O
being	O
out	O
.	O

I	O
shall	O
go	O
for	O
that	O
fellow	O
Japp	B-PER

I	O

him	O

Lawrence	B-PER
opined	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
to	O
make	O
a	O

of	O
doing	O
something	O
.	O

Mary	B-PER
Cavendish	I-PER
said	O
nothing	O
.	O

After	O
tea	O
,	O
I	O
invited	O
Cynthia	B-PER
to	O
come	O
for	O
a	O
walk	O
,	O
and	O
we	O
sauntered	O
off	O
into	O
the	O
woods	O
together	O
.	O

Well	O
?	O

I	O
inquired	O
,	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
we	O
were	O
protected	O
from	O
prying	O
eyes	O
by	O
the	O
leafy	O
screen	O
.	O

With	O
a	O
sigh	O
,	O
Cynthia	B-PER
flung	O
herself	O
down	O
,	O
and	O
tossed	O
off	O
her	O
hat	O
.	O

The	O
sunlight	O
,	O
piercing	O
through	O
the	O
branches	O
,	O
turned	O
the	O
auburn	O
of	O
her	O

Mr.	B-PER
Hastings	I-PER
...	O
you	O
are	O
always	O
so	O
kind	O
,	O
and	O
you	O
know	O
such	O
a	O
lot	O

It	O
struck	O
me	O
at	O
this	O
moment	O
that	O
Cynthia	B-PER
was	O
really	O
a	O
very	O
charming	O
girl	O
!	O

Much	O
more	O
charming	O
than	O
Mary	B-PER
,	O
who	O
never	O
said	O
things	O
of	O
that	O
kind	O
.	O

Well	O
?	O

I	O
asked	O
benignantly	O
,	O
as	O
she	O
hesitated	O

I	O
want	O
to	O
ask	O
your	O

What	O

Do	O

Yes	O

You	O

,	O
Aunt	B-PER
Emily	I-PER
always	O
told	O
me	O
I	O
should	O
be	O
provided	O

I	O
suppose	O
she	O
forgot	O

And	O
I	O
do	O

Do	O

Cynthia	B-PER
hesitated	O
a	O
moment	O
,	O
plucking	O
up	O
the	O
grass	O
with	O
her	O
tiny	O
hands	O

Then	O
she	O
said	O

it	O

Lawrence	B-PER

and	O
Mary	B-PER

What	O

Was	O
it	O

With	O
Poirot	B-PER

I	O
was	O
uncertain	O
how	O

Had	O

Had	O
he	O
not	O

in	O

Should	O
I	O

Though	O

it	O

the	O

Would	O
it	O

For	O

I	O
set	O

Still	O
,	O
I	O
shrank	O

blurting	O

If	O

him	O
to	O

In	O

of	O
myself	O

my	O
opinion	O
of	O

I	O
would	O
never	O

the	O

Yes	O

decidedly	O
,	O
the	O
little	O

After	O
some	O

I	O
decided	O
to	O
take	O
John	B-PER

believe	O
it	O
at	O

it	O
is	O

until	O
you	O

how	O
it	O

everything	O

what	O

was	O
very	O

I	O
believe	O

some	O
tragedy	O
connected	O
with	O
her	O

she	O
took	O
an	O

However	O
that	O
may	O

my	O

with	O

in	O
Yorkshire	B-LOC

She	O
shuddered	O

will	O
understand	O

I	O
say	O

a	O

The	O
narrowness	O

the	O
deadly	O
monotony	O
of	O
it	O

almost	O
drove	O
me	O
mad	O

She	O
paused	O
a	O
minute	O

added	O
in	O
a	O
different	O
tone	O

then	O
I	O
met	O
John	B-PER

Yes	O

You	O
can	O
imagine	O
that	O

from	O
my	O

it	O
was	O

I	O
can	O

it	O
was	O
not	O
this	O
fact	O
which	O
weighed	O
with	O
me	O

No	O

he	O
was	O

a	O
way	O

the	O
insufferable	O
monotony	O
of	O
my	O

I	O
said	O
nothing	O

I	O
was	O

Her	O

I	O
said	O

An	O

over	O
her	O

out	O

with	O
a	O

No	O

Poirot	B-PER
did	O
not	O
make	O
his	O
appearance	O
the	O

there	O
was	O
no	O

But	O
,	O
at	O
lunch-time	O
,	O
there	O
arrived	O
a	O
new	O
piece	O
of	O
evidence	O
...	O
or	O
rather	O
lack	O
of	O
evidence	O
.	O

We	O
had	O
vainly	O
tried	O
to	O
trace	O
the	O
fourth	O
letter	O
,	O
which	O
Mrs.	B-PER
Inglethorp	I-PER
had	O
written	O
on	O
the	O
evening	O
preceding	O
her	O
death	O

Our	O
efforts	O
having	O
been	O
in	O

,	O
we	O
had	O
abandoned	O
the	O
matter	O
,	O
hoping	O
that	O
it	O
might	O
turn	O
up	O
of	O
itself	O
one	O
day	O

And	O
this	O
is	O
just	O
what	O
did	O
happen	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
shape	O
of	O
a	O
communication	O
,	O
which	O
arrived	O
by	O
the	O
second	O
post	O
from	O
a	O
firm	O
of	O
French	O
music	O

,	O
acknowledging	O
Mrs.	B-PER
Inglethorp	I-PER

had	O
been	O
unable	O
to	O
trace	O
a	O
certain	O

So	O
the	O

solving	O
the	O
mystery	O

by	O

of	O
Mrs.	B-PER

's	O
correspondence	O
on	O
the	O
fatal	O
evening	O

Just	O
before	O

I	O
strolled	O
down	O

After	O

Lawrence	B-PER

Lawrence	B-PER

's	O
speech	O

opening	O
the	O

for	O
the	O
defence	O

not	O
a	O
long	O

but	O
it	O
was	O
backed	O
by	O
the	O
full	O
force	O
of	O
his	O

manner	O

Never	O

it	O

the	O

the	O

The	O

he	O

he	O
submitted	O
that	O
there	O

to	O
prove	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
prisoner	O
who	O

concealed	O
the	O

there	O

It	O
was	O

in	O

a	O
wicked	O

attempt	O
on	O

part	O
of	O
some	O
third	O
person	O
to	O
fix	O
the	O
crime	O
on	O
the	O

The	O
prosecution	O
had	O
been	O
unable	O
to	O
produce	O
a	O
shred	O
of	O
evidence	O
in	O
support	O
of	O
their	O
contention	O
that	O
it	O

the	O

The	O
quarrel	O

freely	O

both	O

Sir	B-PER
Ernest	I-PER
nodded	O
carelessly	O
at	O
Mr.	B-PER

stated	O
that	O
if	O

man	O

he	O
would	O
have	O
come	O
forward	O

explain	O
that	O

Mr.	B-PER

who	O

in	O
the	O

He	O
thought	O

What	O
had	O
actually	O

this	O

The	O
prisoner	O
,	O
returning	O
to	O
the	O
house	O
on	O
Tuesday	O
evening	O
,	O
had	O
been	O
authoritatively	O
told	O
that	O

been	O
a	O
violent	O
quarrel	O
between	O
Mr.	B-PER

Mrs.	B-PER
Inglethorp	I-PER

No	O
suspicion	O
had	O
entered	O
the	O
prisoner	O

head	O
that	O
anyone	O

possibly	O
have	O
mistaken	O
his	O
voice	O
for	O
that	O
of	O
Mr.	B-PER
Inglethorp	I-PER

He	O
naturally	O
concluded	O
that	O
his	O

had	O
two	O

The	O
prosecution	O
averred	O
that	O
on	O
Monday	O

July	O
16th	O
,	O
the	O
prisoner	O
had	O
entered	O
the	O

shop	O
in	O
the	O
village	O
,	O
disguised	O
as	O
Mr.	B-PER

The	O
prisoner	O
,	O
on	O
the	O

was	O
at	O
that	O
time	O
at	O
a	O
lonely	O
spot	O
called	O
Marston	B-LOC

Spinney	I-LOC
,	O
where	O
he	O
had	O
been	O
summoned	O
by	O
an	O
anonymous	O
note	O
,	O
couched	O
in	O
blackmailing	O
terms	O

and	O
threatening	O
to	O
reveal	O
certain	O
matters	O
to	O
his	O
wife	O
unless	O
he	O
complied	O
with	O
its	O

The	O

accordingly	O

and	O
after	O
waiting	O
there	O
vainly	O
for	O
half	O
an	O

had	O
returned	O
home	O

Unfortunately	O

he	O
had	O
met	O
with	O
no	O
one	O
on	O
the	O
way	O
there	O
or	O
back	O
who	O
could	O
vouch	O
for	O
the	O
truth	O
of	O
his	O
story	O
,	O
but	O
luckily	O
he	O
had	O
kept	O
the	O
note	O

and	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
produced	O
as	O
evidence	O

As	O
for	O
the	O
statement	O
relating	O
to	O
the	O
destruction	O
of	O
the	O
will	O
,	O
the	O
prisoner	O
had	O
formerly	O
practiced	O
at	O
the	O
Bar	O

and	O
was	O
perfectly	O
well	O
aware	O
that	O
the	O
will	O
made	O
in	O
his	O

a	O
year	O
before	O
was	O
automatically	O
revoked	O
by	O
his	O

He	O
would	O
call	O
evidence	O
to	O
show	O
who	O
did	O
destroy	O
the	O
will	O

and	O
it	O
was	O
possible	O
that	O
that	O
might	O
open	O
up	O
quite	O
a	O

Finally	O
,	O
he	O
would	O
point	O
out	O

that	O
there	O
was	O
evidence	O
against	O
other	O
people	O
besides	O
John	B-PER

He	O
would	O
direct	O
their	O
attention	O
to	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
the	O
evidence	O
against	O
Mr.	B-PER
Lawrence	I-PER
Cavendish	I-PER
was	O
quite	O
as	O
strong	O
,	O
if	O
not	O
stronger	O
than	O
that	O
against	O
his	O

He	O
would	O
now	O
call	O
the	O
prisoner	O

John	B-PER
acquitted	O

in	O
the	O

Under	O
Sir	B-PER
Ernest	I-PER
's	O
skilful	O

,	O
he	O
told	O
his	O
tale	O
credibly	O
and	O
well	O

The	O
anonymous	O
note	O
received	O
by	O
him	O
was	O
produced	O

and	O
handed	O
to	O
the	O

examine	O

The	O

admitted	O
his	O

the	O

At	O
the	O
close	O
of	O
his	O
examination	O

he	O
paused	O

Sir	B-PER

merely	O
smiled	O

and	O
noted	O
with	O
a	O
sharp	O
eye	O
that	O
John	B-PER

protest	O
had	O
produced	O
a	O
very	O
favourable	O
impression	O
on	O
the	O

Then	O
the	O
cross-examination	O
began	O

I	O
understand	O
you	O
to	O
say	O
that	O
it	O
never	O

Is	O

that	O
very	O

No	O

To	O
take	O
the	O

I	O
handed	O
the	O

was	O

tried	O
that	O

and	O
reported	O

In	O
the	O

had	O
ample	O

to	O

I	O
took	O
an	O

verifying	O
my	O

the	O
fragment	O

exactly	O
with	O
a	O
tear	O
in	O
Mrs.	B-PER

's	O
armlet	O
.	O

Also	O
,	O
at	O
the	O
inquest	O
,	O
Mrs.	B-PER
Cavendish	I-PER
declared	O
that	O
she	O
had	O
heard	O

from	O
her	O
own	O
room	O
,	O
the	O
fall	O
of	O
the	O
table	O
by	O
the	O
bed	O

I	O
took	O
an	O
early	O
opportunity	O
of	O
testing	O
that	O
statement	O
by	O
stationing	O
my	O
friend	O
Monsieur	B-PER
Hastings	I-PER
in	O
the	O
left	O
wing	O
of	O
the	O
building	O
,	O
just	O
outside	O
Mrs.	B-PER
Cavendish	I-PER
's	O
door	O
.	O

I	O
myself	O
,	O
in	O
company	O
with	O
the	O
police	O
,	O
went	O
to	O
the	O
deceased	O
's	O
room	O
,	O
and	O
whilst	O
there	O
I	O
,	O
apparently	O
accidentally	O
,	O
knocked	O
over	O
the	O
table	O
in	O
question	O
,	O
but	O
found	O
that	O
,	O
as	O
I	O
had	O
expected	O
,	O
Monsieur	B-PER
Hastings	I-PER
had	O
heard	O
no	O
sound	O
at	O
all	O
.	O

This	O
confirmed	O
my	O
belief	O
that	O
Mrs.	B-PER
Cavendish	I-PER
was	O
not	O
speaking	O
the	O
truth	O
when	O
she	O
declared	O
that	O
she	O
had	O
been	O
dressing	O
in	O
her	O
room	O
at	O
the	O
time	O
of	O
the	O
tragedy	O
.	O

In	O
fact	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
convinced	O
that	O
,	O
far	O
from	O
having	O
been	O
in	O
her	O
own	O
room	O
,	O
Mrs.	B-PER
Cavendish	I-PER
was	O
actually	O
in	O
the	O
deceased	O
's	O
room	O
when	O
the	O
alarm	O
was	O
given	O
.	O

I	O
shot	O
a	O
quick	O
glance	O
at	O
Mary	B-PER
.	O

She	O
was	O
very	O
pale	O
,	O
but	O
smiling	O
.	O

I	O
proceeded	O
to	O
reason	O
on	O
that	O
assumption	O
.	O

Mrs.	B-PER
Cavendish	I-PER
is	O
in	O
her	O
mother-in-law	O
's	O
mother-in-law	O
's	O
room	O
.	O

We	O
will	O
say	O
that	O
she	O
is	O
seeking	O
for	O
something	O
and	O
has	O
not	O
yet	O
found	O
it	O
.	O

Suddenly	O
Mrs.	B-PER
Inglethorp	I-PER
awakens	O
and	O
is	O
seized	O
with	O
an	O
alarming	O
paroxysm	O
.	O

She	O
flings	O
out	O
her	O
arm	O
,	O
overturning	O
the	O
bed	O
table	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
pulls	O
desperately	O
at	O
the	O
bell	O
.	O

Mrs.	B-PER
Cavendish	I-PER
,	O
startled	O
,	O
drops	O
her	O
candle	O
,	O
scattering	O
the	O
grease	O
on	O
the	O
carpet	O

She	O
picks	O
it	O
up	O
,	O
and	O
retreats	O
quickly	O
to	O
Mademoiselle	B-PER
Cynthia	I-PER
's	O
room	O
,	O
closing	O
the	O
door	O
behind	O
her	O
.	O

She	O
hurries	O
out	O
into	O
the	O
passage	O
,	O
for	O
the	O
servants	O
must	O
not	O
find	O
her	O
where	O
she	O
is	O

But	O
it	O
is	O
too	O
late	O

Already	O
footsteps	O
are	O
echoing	O
along	O
the	O
gallery	O
which	O
connects	O
the	O
two	O
wings	O

What	O
can	O
she	O
do	O
?	O

Quick	O
as	O
thought	O
,	O
she	O
hurries	O
back	O
to	O
the	O
young	O
girl	O

and	O
starts	O
shaking	O
her	O

trooping	O
down	O

They	O
are	O
all	O
busily	O
battering	O
at	O
Mrs.	B-PER
Inglethorp	I-PER

It	O
occurs	O
to	O
nobody	O
that	O
Mrs.	B-PER

has	O
not	O
arrived	O
with	O
the	O
rest	O

...	O
and	O
this	O
is	O
significant	O
...	O
I	O
can	O
find	O
no	O
one	O
who	O
saw	O
her	O
come	O
from	O
the	O
other	O

He	O
looked	O
at	O
Mary	B-PER

Am	O
I	O
right	O
,	O
madame	O
?	O

She	O
bowed	O
her	O

Quite	O
right	O

monsieur	O

You	O
understand	O
that	O

if	O
I	O

I	O
would	O
do	O
my	O
husband	O
any	O
good	O
by	O
revealing	O
these	O
facts	O

I	O
would	O
have	O
done	O
so	O

But	O
it	O
did	O
not	O
seem	O
to	O
me	O
to	O
bear	O
upon	O
the	O
question	O
of	O
his	O
guilt	O
or	O
innocence	O

In	O
a	O
sense	O
,	O
that	O
is	O
correct	O

madame	O

But	O
it	O
cleared	O
my	O
mind	O
of	O
many	O
misconceptions	O

left	O
me	O
free	O

She	O

No	O

quietly	O

There	O
is	O
only	O

Nevertheless	O

in	O
no	O

can	O
you	O

Mrs.	B-PER

ordered	O
a	O

lighted	O
in	O
her	O

I	O
gave	O
a	O
gasp	O

What	O
idiots	O
we	O
had	O
been	O
never	O
to	O
think	O
of	O
that	O
fire	O
as	O
being	O
incongruous	O

Yet	O
Mrs.	B-PER
Inglethorp	I-PER
ordered	O
a	O
fire	O
!	O

Why	O
?	O

Because	O
she	O
wished	O
to	O
destroy	O
something	O
,	O
and	O
could	O
think	O
of	O
no	O
other	O
way	O

You	O
will	O
remember	O
that	O
,	O
in	O
consequence	O
of	O
the	O
War	O
economics	O
practiced	O
at	O
Styles	B-LOC
,	O
no	O
waste	O
paper	O
was	O
thrown	O
away	O
.	O

There	O
was	O
therefore	O
no	O
means	O
of	O
destroying	O
a	O
thick	O
document	O
such	O
as	O
a	O
will	O
.	O

The	O
moment	O
I	O
heard	O
of	O
a	O
fire	O
being	O
lighted	O
in	O
Mrs.	B-PER
Inglethorp	I-PER
's	O
room	O
,	O
I	O
leaped	O
to	O
the	O
conclusion	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
to	O
destroy	O
some	O
important	O
document	O
...	O
possibly	O
a	O
will	O
.	O

So	O
the	O
discovery	O
of	O
the	O
charred	O
fragment	O
in	O
the	O
grate	O
was	O
no	O
surprise	O
to	O
me	O

I	O
did	O
not	O

of	O
course	O

know	O
at	O
the	O
time	O
that	O
the	O
will	O
in	O

been	O
made	O
this	O
afternoon	O

and	O
I	O
will	O
admit	O
that	O
,	O
when	O
I	O
learnt	O
that	O
fact	O
,	O
I	O
fell	O
into	O
a	O
grievous	O
error	O
.	O

I	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
conclusion	O
that	O
Mrs.	B-PER
Inglethorp	I-PER
's	O
determination	O
to	O
destroy	O
her	O
will	O
arose	O
as	O
a	O
direct	O
consequence	O
of	O
the	O
quarrel	O
she	O
had	O
that	O
afternoon	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
therefore	O
the	O
quarrel	O
took	O
place	O
after	O
,	O
and	O
not	O
before	O
the	O
making	O
of	O
the	O
will	O

Here	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
know	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
wrong	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
was	O
forced	O
to	O
abandon	O
that	O
idea	O
.	O

I	O
faced	O
the	O
problem	O
from	O
a	O
new	O
standpoint	O

Now	O
,	O
at	O
4	O

Dorcas	B-PER

Mrs.	B-PER

Dorcas	B-PER

the	O

of	O
paper	O

her	O

demanded	O
it	O
from	O
Mrs.	B-PER
Inglethorp	I-PER

assured	O
her	O

quite	O
truly	O

nothing	O

Mrs.	B-PER

made	O
her	O
plans	O

only	O
a	O
woman	O
driven	O

through	O

could	O
have	O
done	O

Some	O
time	O
in	O

she	O
unbolted	O
the	O

into	O
Mademoiselle	B-PER

Possibly	O
she	O
applied	O

She	O
put	O

the	O
morning	O
as	O

She	O
dressed	O

He	O
paused	O
a	O
moment	O

Cynthia	B-PER
interrupted	O

I	O

Mademoiselle	B-PER

slept	O

That	O
admitted	O
of	O
two	O

Either	O
her	O

was	O
feigned	O

which	O

her	O

by	O

With	O
this	O
latter	O
idea	O
in	O
my	O
mind	O
,	O
I	O
examined	O
all	O
the	O
coffee-cups	O
most	O
carefully	O
,	O
remembering	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
Mrs.	B-PER

had	O
brought	O
Mademoiselle	B-PER

her	O
coffee	O
the	O
night	O

I	O
took	O
a	O

from	O

and	O
had	O
them	O
analysed	O
...	O
with	O
no	O

I	O
had	O
counted	O
the	O
cups	O
carefully	O
,	O
in	O
the	O
event	O
of	O
one	O
having	O
been	O
removed	O

Six	O
persons	O
had	O
taken	O
coffee	O

and	O
six	O
cups	O
were	O
duly	O
found	O

I	O
had	O
to	O
confess	O
myself	O
mistaken	O

Then	O
I	O
discovered	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
been	O
guilty	O
of	O
a	O
very	O
grave	O
oversight	O

Coffee	O

DrBauerstein	B-PER

been	O
there	O
that	O

This	O
changed	O
the	O

of	O
the	O
whole	O
affair	O
,	O
for	O
there	O
was	O
now	O
one	O
cup	O
missing	O

The	O

noticed	O
nothing	O

Annie	B-PER

the	O
housemaid	O

who	O
took	O
in	O
the	O

brought	O
in	O
seven	O
cups	O
,	O
not	O
knowing	O
that	O
Mr.	B-PER

Dorcas	B-PER

the	O
one	O
found	O
broken	O
in	O
Mrs.	B-PER
Inglethorp	I-PER

I	O
was	O
confident	O
that	O
the	O
missing	O
cup	O
was	O
that	O
of	O
Mademoiselle	B-PER
Cynthia	I-PER
.	O

I	O
had	O
an	O
additional	O
reason	O
for	O
that	O
belief	O
in	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
all	O
the	O
cups	O
found	O
contained	O
sugar	O
,	O
which	O
Mademoiselle	B-PER
Cynthia	I-PER
never	O
took	O
in	O
her	O

My	O
attention	O
was	O
attracted	O
by	O
the	O
story	O
of	O
Annie	B-PER
about	O
some	O
`	O
salt	O
'	O
on	O
the	O
tray	O

which	O
she	O
took	O
every	O
night	O
to	O
Mrs.	B-PER
Inglethorp	I-PER

room	O

I	O
accordingly	O
secured	O
a	O
sample	O
of	O
that	O
cocoa	O
,	O
and	O
sent	O
it	O
to	O
be	O
analysed	O

But	O
that	O
had	O
already	O
been	O
done	O
by	O
Dr	B-PER

there	O

We	O

to	O
a	O
little	O
difficulty	O

in	O
Mrs.	B-PER
Inglethorp	I-PER

There	O
were	O
some	O
peculiar	O
points	O
about	O
that	O
stain	O

It	O
was	O
still	O

exhaled	O
a	O

of	O
coffee	O

imbedded	O

nap	O

I	O
found	O
some	O
little	O
splinters	O

What	O
had	O
happened	O
was	O
plain	O
to	O
me	O

for	O
not	O
two	O

In	O
exactly	O
the	O

Mrs.	B-PER

What	O
happened	O
next	O
is	O
mere	O
guess	O

on	O
my	O

but	O
I	O
should	O
say	O
that	O
Mrs.	B-PER
Inglethorp	I-PER
picked	O
up	O
the	O
broken	O
cup	O

was	O

in	O

so	O
much	O
evidence	O
against	O

that	O
I	O
was	O
inclined	O
to	O
believe	O
that	O

discovered	O

had	O
nothing	O
to	O
do	O
with	O
Mrs.	B-PER

his	O

was	O
attracted	O
by	O
the	O
farmer	O

wife	O
,	O
his	O
silence	O
bore	O
quite	O
a	O
different	O
interpretation	O

It	O
was	O
nonsense	O
to	O
pretend	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
afraid	O
of	O
the	O
scandal	O

as	O
no	O
possible	O
scandal	O
could	O
attach	O

This	O

gave	O
me	O
furiously	O

Mrs.	B-PER

And	O
then	O
...	O
he	O
makes	O
his	O

Mrs.	B-PER
Inglethorp	I-PER
is	O
out	O

and	O
he	O
sits	O
down	O
to	O

to	O
his	O

who	O

he	O
fears	O

may	O

in	O
a	O
panic	O
at	O
the	O
nonsuccess	O
of	O

It	O
is	O
probable	O
that	O
Mrs.	B-PER
Inglethorp	I-PER
returned	O
earlier	O
than	O
he	O
expected	O
.	O

Caught	O
in	O
the	O
act	O
,	O
and	O
somewhat	O
flurried	O
he	O
hastily	O
shuts	O
and	O
locks	O
his	O
desk	O

He	O
fears	O
that	O
if	O
he	O
remains	O
in	O
the	O
room	O
he	O
may	O
have	O
to	O
open	O
it	O
again	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
Mrs.	B-PER
Inglethorp	I-PER
might	O
catch	O
sight	O
of	O
the	O
letter	O
before	O
he	O
could	O
snatch	O
it	O
up	O
.	O

So	O
he	O
goes	O
out	O
and	O
walks	O
in	O
the	O
woods	O
,	O
little	O
dreaming	O
that	O
Mrs.	B-PER
Inglethorp	I-PER
will	O
open	O
his	O
desk	O
,	O
and	O
discover	O
the	O
incriminating	O
document	O
.	O

But	O
this	O
,	O
as	O
we	O
know	O
,	O
is	O
what	O
happened	O
.	O

Mrs.	B-PER
Inglethorp	I-PER
reads	O
it	O
,	O
and	O
becomes	O
aware	O
of	O
the	O
perfidy	O
of	O
her	O
husband	O
and	O
Evelyn	B-PER
Howard	I-PER
,	O
though	O
,	O
unfortunately	O
,	O
the	O
sentence	O
about	O
the	O
bromides	O
conveys	O
no	O
warning	O
to	O
her	O
mind	O

She	O
knows	O
that	O
she	O
is	O
in	O
danger	O
...	O
but	O
is	O
ignorant	O
of	O
where	O
the	O
danger	O
lies	O
.	O

She	O
decides	O
to	O
say	O
nothing	O
to	O
her	O
husband	O
,	O
but	O
sits	O
down	O
and	O
writes	O
to	O
her	O
solicitor	O
,	O
asking	O
him	O
to	O
come	O
on	O
the	O
morrow	O
,	O
and	O
she	O
also	O
determines	O
to	O
destroy	O
immediately	O
the	O
will	O
which	O
she	O
has	O
just	O
made	O
.	O

She	O
keeps	O
the	O
fatal	O
letter	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
to	O
discover	O
that	O
letter	O
,	O
then	O
,	O
that	O
her	O
husband	O
forced	O
the	O
lock	O
of	O
the	O
despatch-case	O
?	O

Yes	O
,	O
and	O
from	O
the	O
enormous	O
risk	O
he	O
ran	O
we	O
can	O
see	O
how	O
fully	O
he	O
realized	O
its	O
importance	O
.	O

That	O
letter	O
excepted	O
,	O
there	O
was	O
absolutely	O
nothing	O
to	O
connect	O
him	O
with	O
the	O
crime	O
.	O

There	O
's	O
only	O
one	O
thing	O
I	O
ca	O
n't	O
make	O
out	O
,	O
why	O
did	O
n't	O
he	O
destroy	O
it	O
at	O
once	O
when	O
he	O
got	O
hold	O
of	O
it	O
?	O

Because	O
he	O
did	O
not	O
dare	O
take	O
the	O
biggest	O
risk	O
of	O
all	O
...	O
that	O
of	O
keeping	O
it	O
on	O
his	O
own	O
person	O
.	O

I	O
do	O
n't	O
understand	O
.	O

Look	O
at	O
it	O
from	O
his	O
point	O
of	O
view	O
.	O

I	O
have	O
discovered	O
that	O
there	O
were	O
only	O
five	O
short	O
minutes	O
in	O
which	O
he	O
could	O
have	O
taken	O
it	O
...	O
the	O
five	O
minutes	O
immediately	O
before	O
our	O
own	O
arrival	O
on	O
the	O
scene	O
,	O
for	O
before	O
that	O
time	O
Annie	B-PER
was	O
brushing	O
the	O
stairs	O
,	O
and	O
would	O
have	O
seen	O
anyone	O
who	O
passed	O
going	O
to	O
the	O
right	O
wing	O
.	O

Figure	O
to	O
yourself	O
the	O
scene	O
!	O

He	O
enters	O
the	O
room	O
,	O
unlocking	O
the	O
door	O
by	O
means	O
of	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
other	O
doorkeys	O
...	O
they	O
were	O
all	O
much	O
alike	O
.	O

He	O
hurries	O
to	O
the	O
despatch-case	O
...	O
it	O
is	O
locked	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
keys	O
are	O
nowhere	O
to	O
be	O
seen	O
.	O

That	O
is	O
a	O
terrible	O
blow	O
to	O
him	O
,	O
for	O
it	O
means	O
that	O
his	O
presence	O
in	O
the	O
room	O
can	O
not	O
be	O
concealed	O
as	O
he	O
had	O
hoped	O
.	O

But	O
he	O
sees	O
clearly	O
that	O
everything	O
must	O
be	O
risked	O
for	O
the	O
sake	O
of	O
that	O
damning	O
piece	O
of	O
evidence	O
.	O

Quickly	O
,	O
he	O
forces	O
the	O
lock	O
with	O
a	O
penknife	O
,	O
and	O
turns	O
over	O
the	O
papers	O
until	O
he	O
finds	O
what	O
he	O
is	O
looking	O
for	O
.	O

But	O
now	O
a	O
fresh	O
dilemma	O
arises	O
:	O
he	O
dare	O
not	O
keep	O
that	O
piece	O
of	O
paper	O
on	O
him	O
.	O

He	O
may	O
be	O
seen	O
leaving	O
the	O
room	O
...	O
he	O
may	O
be	O
searched	O
.	O

If	O
the	O
paper	O
is	O
found	O
on	O
him	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
certain	O
doom	O
.	O

Probably	O
,	O
at	O
this	O
minute	O
,	O
too	O
,	O
he	O
hears	O
the	O
sounds	O
below	O
of	O
Mr.	B-PER
Wells	I-PER
and	O
John	B-PER
leaving	O
the	O
boudoir	O
.	O

He	O
must	O
act	O
quickly	O
.	O

Where	O
can	O
he	O
hide	O
this	O
terrible	O
slip	O
of	O
paper	O
?	O

The	O

any	O

``	O
There	O
are	O

He	O

what	O

I	O
shook	O
my	O

In	O
a	O
moment	O

No	O

he	O
will	O

at	O

to	O

And	O
,	O
if	O

Dear	O

I	O
murmured	O

so	O
that	O
is	O
the	O
explanation	O
of	O
your	O
extraordinary	O
behaviour	O

You	O
rushed	O

Yes	O

and	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
race	O
for	O
time	O

But	O
I	O
still	O
ca	O
n't	O
understand	O
why	O
Inglethorp	B-PER
was	O
such	O
a	O
fool	O
as	O
to	O
leave	O
it	O
there	O
when	O
he	O
had	O
plenty	O
of	O
opportunity	O
to	O
destroy	O
it	O

Ah	O

but	O
he	O
had	O
no	O
opportunity	O

I	O
saw	O
to	O
that	O

You	O
?	O

Yes	O

Do	O
you	O
remember	O
reproving	O

Yes	O

Well	O

my	O

I	O
saw	O
there	O
was	O
just	O
one	O
chance	O

I	O
was	O
not	O
sure	O
then	O
if	O
Inglethorp	B-PER
was	O
the	O
criminal	O
or	O
not	O
,	O
but	O
if	O
he	O
was	O
I	O
reasoned	O
that	O
he	O
would	O
not	O
have	O
the	O
paper	O
on	O
him	O
,	O
but	O
would	O
have	O
hidden	O
it	O
somewhere	O
,	O
and	O
by	O
enlisting	O
the	O
sympathy	O
of	O
the	O
household	O
I	O
could	O
effectually	O
prevent	O
his	O
destroying	O
it	O
.	O

He	O
was	O
already	O
under	O
suspicion	O
,	O
and	O
by	O
making	O
the	O
matter	O
public	O
I	O
secured	O
the	O
services	O
of	O
about	O
ten	O
amateur	O
detectives	O
,	O
who	O
would	O
be	O
watching	O
him	O
unceasingly	O
,	O
and	O
being	O
himself	O
aware	O
of	O
their	O
watchfulness	O
he	O
would	O
not	O
dare	O
seek	O
further	O
to	O
destroy	O
the	O
document	O

He	O
was	O
therefore	O
forced	O
to	O
depart	O
from	O
the	O
house	O

leaving	O
it	O
in	O
the	O

But	O
surely	O
Miss	B-PER

had	O
ample	O

the	O
letter	O
she	O
had	O
received	O
from	O
Mrs.	B-PER

what	O
was	O
there	O

about	O

You	O

Yes	O

You	O
will	O

that	O

Why	O
does	O
Miss	B-PER

suppress	O

again	O

And	O
at	O

a	O
suspicion	O
dawned	O
in	O

You	O
will	O
remember	O
my	O
saying	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
wise	O
to	O

of	O
people	O
who	O
were	O
not	O

And	O
yet	O
,	O
I	O
cried	O
indignantly	O

after	O
that	O

you	O
gave	O
me	O
two	O
reasons	O

Miss	B-PER

the	O

And	O
very	O
good	O
reasons	O
too	O

replied	O
Poirot	B-PER

For	O
a	O
long	O
time	O
they	O
were	O
a	O
stumbling-block	O
to	O
me	O
until	O
I	O
remembered	O
a	O
very	O
significant	O
fact	O
:	O
that	O
she	O
and	O
Alfred	B-PER
Inglethorp	I-PER
were	O
cousins	O

She	O
could	O
not	O
have	O
committed	O
the	O
crime	O
single-handed	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
reasons	O
against	O
that	O
did	O
not	O
debar	O
her	O
from	O
being	O
an	O
accomplice	O

And	O
,	O
then	O
,	O
there	O
was	O
that	O
rather	O
over-vehement	O
over-vehement	O
hatred	O
of	O
hers	O
!	O

It	O
concealed	O
a	O
very	O
opposite	O
emotion	O

There	O
was	O
,	O
undoubtedly	O
,	O
a	O
tie	O
of	O
passion	O
between	O
them	O
long	O
before	O
he	O
came	O
to	O
Styles	B-LOC

They	O
had	O
already	O
arranged	O
their	O
infamous	O
plot	O
...	O
that	O
he	O
should	O
marry	O
this	O
rich	O

rather	O
foolish	O
old	O
lady	O

induce	O
her	O
to	O
make	O
a	O

her	O
money	O
to	O
him	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
gain	O
their	O
ends	O
by	O
a	O
very	O
cleverly	O
conceived	O
crime	O

If	O
all	O
had	O
gone	O
as	O
they	O

they	O

fix	O

John	B-PER

I	O

would	O

that	O

have	O

there	O

what	O
made	O
Monsieur	B-PER

he	O
first	O
entered	O
his	O
mother	O

on	O
the	O

was	O
because	O

whilst	O
his	O

there	O
,	O
obviously	O
poisoned	O

that	O
the	O

that	O

That	O
John	B-PER

eventually	O
decided	O
in	O
favour	O
of	O
'	O
a	O
woman	O
's	O
happiness	O
'	O
.	O

Nothing	O
but	O
the	O
great	O
danger	O
through	O
which	O
they	O
have	O
passed	O
could	O
have	O
brought	O
these	O
two	O
proud	O
souls	O
together	O
again	O
.	O

I	O
looked	O
at	O
Poirot	B-PER
in	O
silent	O
amazement	O
.	O

The	O
colossal	O
cheek	O
of	O
the	O
little	O
man	O
!	O

Who	O
on	O
earth	O
but	O
Poirot	B-PER
would	O
have	O
thought	O
of	O
a	O
trial	O
for	O
murder	O
as	O
a	O
restorer	O
of	O
conjugal	O
happiness	O
!	O

I	O
perceive	O
your	O
thoughts	O

mon	O

Poirot	B-PER
,	O
smiling	O
at	O
me	O
.	O

No	O
one	O
but	O
Hercule	B-PER
Poirot	I-PER
would	O
have	O
attempted	O
such	O
a	O
thing	O
!	O

And	O
you	O
are	O
wrong	O
in	O
condemning	O
it	O
.	O

The	O
happiness	O
of	O
one	O
man	O
and	O
one	O
woman	O
is	O
the	O
greatest	O
thing	O
in	O
all	O
the	O
world	O
.	O

His	O
words	O
took	O
me	O
back	O
to	O
earlier	O
events	O
.	O

I	O
remembered	O
Mary	B-PER
as	O
she	O
lay	O
white	O
and	O
exhausted	O
on	O
the	O
sofa	O
,	O
listening	O
,	O
listening	O
.	O

There	O
had	O
come	O
the	O
sound	O
of	O
the	O
bell	O
below	O
.	O

She	O
had	O
started	O
up	O
.	O

Poirot	B-PER
had	O
opened	O
the	O
door	O
,	O
and	O
meeting	O
her	O
agonized	O
eyes	O
had	O
nodded	O
gently	O
.	O

Yes	O
,	O
madame	O
,	O
he	O
said	O
.	O

I	O
have	O
brought	O
him	O
back	O
to	O
you	O
.	O

He	O
had	O
stood	O
aside	O
,	O
and	O
as	O
I	O
went	O
out	O
I	O
had	O
seen	O
the	O
look	O
in	O
Mary	B-PER
's	O
eyes	O
,	O
as	O
John	B-PER
Cavendish	I-PER
had	O
caught	O
his	O
wife	O
in	O
his	O
arms	O
.	O

Perhaps	O
you	O
are	O
right	O
,	O
Poirot	B-PER
,	O
I	O
said	O
gently	O
.	O

Yes	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
the	O
greatest	O
thing	O
in	O
the	O
world	O
.	O

Suddenly	O
,	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
tap	O
at	O
the	O
door	O
,	O
and	O
Cynthia	B-PER
peeped	O
in	O
.	O

I.	O
.	O

.	O

I	O
only	O
...	O
.	O

Come	O
in	O
,	O
I	O
said	O
,	O
springing	O
up	O

She	O
came	O
in	O
,	O
but	O
did	O
not	O
sit	O
down	O
.	O

I.	O
.	O

.	O

only	O
wanted	O
to	O
tell	O
you	O
something	O
...	O
.	O

Yes	O
?	O

Cynthia	B-PER
fidgeted	O
with	O
a	O
little	O
tassel	O
for	O
some	O
moments	O
,	O
then	O
,	O
suddenly	O
exclaiming	O
:	O
You	O
dears	O
!	O

kissed	O
first	O
me	O
and	O
then	O
Poirot	B-PER
,	O
and	O
rushed	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
room	O
again	O
.	O

What	O
on	O
earth	O
does	O
this	O
mean	O
?	O

I	O
asked	O
,	O
surprised	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
very	O
nice	O
to	O
be	O
kissed	O
by	O
Cynthia	B-PER
,	O
but	O
the	O
publicity	O
of	O
the	O
salute	O
rather	O
impaired	O
the	O
pleasure	O
.	O

It	O
means	O
that	O
she	O
has	O
discovered	O
Monsieur	B-PER
Lawrence	I-PER
does	O
not	O
dislike	O
her	O
as	O
much	O
as	O
she	O
thought	O
,	O
replied	O
Poirot	B-PER
philosophically	O
.	O

But	O
...	O
.	O

Here	O
he	O
is	O
.	O

Lawrence	B-PER
at	O
that	O
moment	O
passed	O
the	O
door	O

Eh	O

Monsieur	B-PER
Lawrence	I-PER
,	O
called	O
Poirot	B-PER

We	O
must	O
congratulate	O
you	O
,	O
is	O
it	O
not	O
so	O
?	O

Lawrence	B-PER
blushed	O
,	O
and	O
then	O
smiled	O
awkwardly	O
.	O

A	O
man	O
in	O
love	O
is	O
a	O
sorry	O
spectacle	O
.	O

Now	O
Cynthia	B-PER
had	O
looked	O
charming	O

I	O
sighed	O

What	O
is	O
it	O
,	O
mon	O
ami	O
?	O

Nothing	O

Never	O
